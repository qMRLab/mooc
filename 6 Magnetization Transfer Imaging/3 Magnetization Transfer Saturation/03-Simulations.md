In line with our previous MTR blog post, we employ the qMRLab qMT simulations to model MTsat measurements and subsequently calculate MTsat values from equations 7-9. Table 2 lists the essential tissue parameters used for the simulations. Figure 4 plots the MTsat values that have been calculated for each protocol outlined in Table 1, while also incorporating the relevant tissue parameters found in Table 2.
