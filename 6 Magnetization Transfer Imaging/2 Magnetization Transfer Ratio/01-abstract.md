Conventional MRI techniques, such as those used for clinical diagnosis, can only directly measure hydrogen bonded to water molecules. Thus, a non-negligible proportion of body mass is not visible with clinical MRIs, such as non-hydrogen atoms (different resonance frequencies) and hydrogen atoms bonded to large molecules which restricts the motion of the atoms (rapid signal decay, T2 ~ Î¼s). The latter, called macromolecules, play an important role in the physiology of the body; for example, myelin in the white matter of the brain plays an important role in signal transmission, and is composed largely of macromolecules (lipids and proteins). Although the images acquired by clinical MRI machines can only be generated from signal from mobile hydrogen, these do interact with nearby molecules and atoms via the electromagnetic fields they mutually generate, and in the 70s and 80s a cross-relaxation mechanism was discovered that sensitizes mobile protons to nearby targeted semi-solid molecules, such as myelin (H. T. Edzes and Samulski 1977; Hommo T. Edzes and Samulski 1978; Wolff and Balaban 1989). With proper experimental design, the higher the density of nearby macromolecules in the tissue, the lower the resulting conventional MRI signal would be. This class of MRI techniques is known as magnetization transfer (MT) imaging.

In the simplest and most used MT imaging method, only two images are acquired (one with MT preparation, and one without), and a normalized difference between the two images is calculated. This quantity is known as the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and has been used extensively to infer information on myelin diseases and disorders, such as multiple sclerosis. The proportional relationship between MTR and myelin density has been established using post-mortem immunohistological studies in humans (Schmierer et al. 2004, 2007) and animals (Merkler et al. 2005; Zaaraoui et al. 2008). MTR has also already been used in clinical drug trials for MS (Maguire et al. 2013; Brown et al. 2016). MTR has been widely used thanks to the fact that most scanners are equipped with the necessary software so that it can be added to an imaging protocol with the click of a button, and it is also a very quick measurement with a short acquisition time.
