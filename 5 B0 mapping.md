# B0 inhomogeneities


The main magnetic field, also called the _B_{sub}`0` field, plays a crucial role in MRI. It dictates the precessional frequency of the spins and sets-up the bulk magnetization, which plays an important role in the image signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the radio frequency coils, tuned to the _B_{sub}`0` field, are responsible for flipping the spins in the transverse plane and for acquiring the signal. However, imaging reconstruction techniques assume a perfectly homogeneous _B_{sub}`0` field to reconstruct the signal from k-space data. An inhomogeneous _B_{sub}`0` field can lead to image artifacts such as signal loss, distortions [@Jezzard1995-qd], poor fat saturation [@Anzai1992-jl] and many other image artifacts. In extreme cases, it can completely hinder the ability to create an image. _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities are also problematic for MR spectroscopy (MRS), because they widen the spectral linewidth.

When a subject is introduced in the scanner, the static _B_{sub}`0` field can be rendered more homogeneous through a technique called active shimming. Active shimming sends the appropriate amount of current through specific gradient and shim coils, in order to generate a magnetic field that will compensate for the existing (inhomogeneous) magnetic field. This procedure requires precise and accurate mapping of the _B_{sub}`0` field. _B_{sub}`0` maps show the difference between the current field and the expected field, and are typically displayed in units of magnetic field strength (Tesla [T]), precessional frequency (Hertz [Hz]) or in parts per million (ppm). [](#b0Eq1) can be used to convert from the different units. 

```{math}
:label: b0Eq1

\begin{equation}
\frac{f-f_{0}}{f_{0}}\ast10^{6}=\frac{\Delta f}{f_{0}}\ast10^{6}=\frac{B-B_{0}}{B_{0}}\ast10^{6}=\frac{\Delta B}{B_{0}}\ast10^{6}=\delta_{ppm}
\end{equation}
```

where {math}`f`, {math}`f_{0}` and {math}`\Delta f` represent the actual precessional frequency, the [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession) and the difference between current and the [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession) ({math}`f-f_{0}=\Delta f`) respectively. _B_, _B_{sub}_0_ and Œî _B_ all have similar interpretations as {math}`f`, {math}`f_{0}` and {math}`\Delta f` but are in units of field strength (T). The relationship between frequency and field strength can be found using the well known [Larmor equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession) ({math}`f=\gamma B / 2\pi`). {math}`\delta_{ppm}` is the field offset in ppm.

### Hardware

Although scanner manufacturers try to make magnets that are as homogeneous as possible, they are far from perfect. The manufacturing process requires many kilometers of superconducting wire to be wound to create the main magnet and can lead to inhomogeneities due to manufacturing tolerances. Moreover, large metal objects near the scanner can interact with the field created by the scanner and impact the resulting field within the scanner. This is a more important problem with higher field strength. During the installation process, the empty bore is homogenized in a process called passive shimming. During this process, small ferromagnetic pieces are introduced in the scanner at optimized locations to produce a field that counteracts the inhomogeneities. Hardware inhomogeneities are relatively small (less than 1 ppm [@Webb2016-xp]).

Specialized equipment such as field probes [@Dietrich2016-iy] (e.g.: Skope Magnetic Resonance Technologies, LLC) can be used to evaluate the _B_{sub}`0` field of the scanner while it is being installed. This equipment can also be used after installation because it is more precise than _B_{sub}`0` field maps and offers better field temporal resolution, allowing the ability to observe [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) created from gradient switching.

During an imaging session, heating of the different components and of the main magnet can lead to temperature-dependent changes in the _B_{sub}`0` field. These can be observed by a frequency drift in the field. As an example, a ~0.4Hz/min has been observed in MRS at 3T but depends on multiple factors [@noauthor_2021-cr]. Modern scanners usually have systems in place to evaluate and correct for this drift [@El-Sharkawy2006-hl].

### Magnetic susceptibility

Materials have a property called magnetic susceptibility () that reflects their ability to become magnetized in response to an external magnetic field [@Schenck1996-gu]. The change in magnetic field Bz (the subscript ‚Äúz‚Äù is shown to make it explicit that we are referring to the component parallel to the _B_{sub}`0` field) is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility value, the magnetic field strength, and can be affected by the geometry and location of the tissues. It can be modeled as a convolution of the difference in magnetic susceptibility  with the component parallel to the magnetic field induced by a unit magnetic dipole ({math}`d=\frac{\left( 3\text{cos}^{2}\left( \theta \right)-1 \right)}{4\pi\left| \textbf{r} \right|^{3}}`) in spherical coordinates where {math}` \textbf{r} ` is the position vector and  is the angle with _B_{sub}`0` [@De_Rochefort2008-tb]. 

```{math}

\Delta B_{z}\left( \textbf{r} \right)=B_{0}\left( \Delta\chi \left( \textbf{r} \right) \otimes  d \left( \textbf{r} \right)\right) 
\end{equation}

When a subject is introduced in the scanner, it interacts with the _B_{sub}`0` field and distorts it. Therefore, a perfectly homogeneous field in an empty bore will usually have an inhomogeneous _B_{sub}`0` field once a patient is introduced. This is the reason why active shimming is required when a patient is introduced in the scanner. Although these inhomogeneities happen everywhere in the body, stronger field variations occur at the boundaries of strong susceptibility differences such as air (slightly paramagnetic: {math}`+\chi`) and water/tissue (diamagnetic: {math}`-\chi`). 

The following figure shows different susceptibility distributions in ppm for a homogeneous cylinder within a larger homogeneous cylinder placed in a homogeneous background (top) and a brain (bottom). The corresponding _B_{sub}`0` field maps are simulated at 7 T and shown in [](#b0Plot3). In the brain, the _B_{sub}`0` field inhomogeneities are dominated by air-tissue boundaries. On the right-hand panel, the slow varying spatial variations (also called background field) were removed to show the local field variations.

An in-vivo susceptibility map was used for the brain and was surrounded with air. Note that this simplistic representation still shows the field map being dominated by air-tissue interfaces even though the spatial characteristics of the field are not perfectly representative of reality. An in-vivo field map can be seen in [](#b0Plot9).

## Effects on signal

To excite the spins in the transverse plane, a carrier frequency tuned to the [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession) is used by the transmit coil. If the frequency of the spins does not match the excitation frequency, it results in a suboptimal tip of the spins in the transverse plane. If the frequency of the spins varies across the ROI, the flip angle is affected differently across the image [@Wang2006-hh].

When a signal is acquired, it is demodulated to remove the carrier frequency ([Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession)) from the signal. An example of a FID is shown in [](#b0Plot4). The number of species represent the number of isochromats in the simulation. An isochromat represents an ensemble of spins with the same properties rotating at the same [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession). For a single isochromat, if the acquired signal and demodulation frequency perfectly match, the _T_{sub}`2` signal can be recovered. If the carrier frequency is different from the expected frequency (such as when there are inhomogeneities), the demodulation introduces low-frequency variations. A non-homogeneous sample is also shown featuring many isochromats. Alternatively, a homogeneous sample with a non-homogeneous _B_{sub}`0` field could be simulated as well and would have a similar shape as the one with multiple species. In that case, the difference from the _T_{sub}`2` curve would reflect _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*` ({math}`1/T_{2}^{*}=1/T_{2}+1/T_{2}^{'}`) effects. During the relaxation process, spins precessing at different frequencies, due to the presence  of _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities, will give rise to phase offsets between the spins within a voxel. This intravoxel phase dispersion leads to signal decay.

The resulting shape of the graphs depends on the relative amplitudes and frequencies.
:::

_B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities can lead to distorted k-space trajectories during the readout gradient. This effect is worse during further k-space traversal due to the compounding of the errors. When inhomogeneities are present, the frequencies of the spins are altered. The one-to-one relationship between frequency and spatial location (required to obtain accurate spatial correspondence) is broken. This leads to geometric distortions. [](#b0Plot5) shows an animation of the filing of k-space of an EPI sequence using bi-polar readouts. A theoretical trajectory is shown as well as a trajectory where a constant parasite gradient in the phase encoding direction has been added. One can observe the trajectory differences.

The trajectory with the parasite gradient deviates from the theoretical trajectory. All encoding gradients (G) are instantaneously applied at 40 mT/m. A parasit G{sub}`p,phase` of 0.1mT/m (G/G{sub}`p,phase`=0.25%) is added to simulate inhomogeneities. 64 encoding steps are used in both the frequency and phase encoding directions but only one in five phase encoding lines is shown for visualization purposes.
:::

Radiofrequency (RF) pulses can also be affected by an inhomogeneous _B_{sub}`0` field. During slice selection for example, the RF pulse excites a range of frequencies that can be mapped to spatial locations by applying a linearly evolving magnetic field along the slice direction. For a perfectly transverse acquisition, the resulting _B_{sub}`0` field can be expressed by ({math}`G_{z}z+ B_{0}`). If _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities are present ({math}`G_{z}z+ B_{0} +\Delta B_{0} (x,y,z)`), the excited slice profile can be distorted or offset from the expected location. When _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities are very inhomogeneous, they can also disrupt frequency-selective RF pulses such as fat saturation pulses. There are also other effects such as ringing artifacts, blurring, and ghosting that can occur.

All of these effects can be minimized with _B_{sub}`0` shimming. To do so, a map of the _B_{sub}`0` field can be acquired. In addition to shimming, _B_{sub}`0` mapping is important for other techniques that will be discussed later. The next section will show how to perform _B_{sub}`0` mapping using two echoes.

(b0DualEcho)=
# Dual echo B0 mapping


_B_{sub}`0` mapping estimates the _B_{sub}`0` field from the expected field for every voxel. These _B_{sub}`0` maps can be used to perform prospective _B_{sub}`0` shimming to minimize _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities [@Jezzard1995-qd], they can be used to retrospectively correct for geometric distortions (FSL FUGUE [@Jenkinson2012-np;@Smith2004-av]) (e.g.: for EPI), or to perform retrospective correction for k-space readout trajectory (e.g.: for spiral readout). Moreover, they can be used for retrospective recovery of enhanced signal decay [@An2002-ys;@Alonso-Ortiz2017-yo], for _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*` mapping and they are also vital to quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) where the goal is to map the susceptibility of the subject.

One of the most simple and widely adopted techniques used to perform _B_{sub}`0` mapping is the 2-echo phase difference technique. This technique is faster and simpler than most other alternatives. Before we dive into the technique, let's dip our toes in some theory.

## Signal Theory


In the ideal case, spins rotate at the [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession), shown in blue in [](#b0Plot6). In the presence of field inhomogeneities, the frequency of the spins (shown in red) is different and is proportional to the field inhomogeneities. Both the laboratory and rotating frame of reference are shown. Importantly, note that the [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession) phase appears stationary in the rotating frame of reference. 

:::{figure} #b0Fig6jn
:label: b0Plot6
:enumerator: 5.6
Two spins rotating (one at the Larmor frequency ({math}`f_{0}`), one at a lower frequency). A view of the spins in the transverse plane (left) and of their phase (right) is shown. A dropdown is available to select between the laboratory frame and the rotating frame of reference.
:::

The phase ({math}`\phi`) evolution follows the following equation (not considering transient effects such as [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current)) in the rotating frame of reference.

```{math}
:label: b0Eq3
:enumerator:5.3
\begin{equation}
\phi\left(\textbf{r},t \right) = \phi_{0}\left( \textbf{r} \right)+\gamma\Delta B_{0}\left( \textbf{r} \right)\cdot t
\end{equation}
```

where x,y,z are the coordinate locations, t is time,  is the gyromagnetic ratio, _B_{sub}`0` is the _B_{sub}`0` field offset (Tesla) and {math}`\phi_{0}` is an initial constant phase offset (e.g.: coil induced, material induced through local conductivity/permittivity). We can observe phase evolution through time in [](#b0Plot7) by looking at phase data acquired in the brain at progressively longer echo times. The phase at a single voxel changes linearly (not considering transient effects). Note that the sharp variations forming vertical lines in the previous figure are called phase wraps and occur because the phase is defined over - to . Phase-wrapping effects will be discussed in more detail in the following section. Wraps can also occur spatially as sharp variations as seen in the following figure. Note that the longer the echo times, the more wraps there are.

:::{figure} #b0Fig7jn
:label: b0Plot7
:enumerator: 5.7

:::

MRI manufacturers do not all output phase data by default. It should be possible to toggle the output of phase data on all MRI systems. It can also be computed from real/imaginary data using [](#b0Eq4).

```{math}
:label: b0Eq4
:enumerator:5.4
\begin{equation}
\angle \left( \text{real}+i\text{ imaginary} \right) =\text{arctan2}\left( \text{imaginary, real} \right)
\end{equation}
```

where {math}`\angle` is the phase operator. 

As phase changes linearly with time (t) and with the field offset (_B_{sub}`0`), it is possible to acquire two phase images at two different echo times and compute _B_{sub}`0`(x,y,z).


```{math}
:label: b0Eq5
:enumerator:5.5
\begin{equation}
\Delta B_{0}\left( \textbf{r} \right)=\frac{\phi\left( \textbf{r}, \text{TE}_{2} \right)-\phi\left( \textbf{r}, \text{TE}_{1} \right)}{\gamma\cdot \left( \text{TE}_{2}-\text{TE}_{1}  \right)}=\frac{\Delta\phi\left( \textbf{r}\text{,}\Delta \text{TE}\right)}{\gamma\Delta\text{TE}}
\end{equation}
```

where TE{sub}`1` and TE{sub}`2` are the echo times, and  TE = TE{sub}`2`- TE{sub}`1`. To compute the phase offset {math}`\Delta \phi`, phase subtraction is necessary. The complex difference can be used to keep the phase between {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi`, although other phase difference techniques are also possible.

```{math}
:label: b0Eq6
:enumerator:5.6
\begin{equation}
\Delta\phi\left( \textbf{r},\Delta\text{TE} \right)=\angle \left( \text{e}^{i\phi\left( \textbf{r}\text{,TE}_{2} \right)} \right)\cdot \left( \text{e}^{-i\phi\left( \textbf{r}\text{,TE}_{1} \right)} \right)
\end{equation}
```

In some sequences, the phase images are exported as a single phase difference image {math}`\Delta \phi \left( x,y,z, \Delta \text{TE} \right)`.

## Single Frequency Population

To build intuition about field maps, let us imagine a sample at a constant offset frequency from {math}`f_{0}` . Note that this simplistic representation of the field typically does not occur due to how the susceptibilities of the neighboring regions interact with one another to create the _B_{sub}`0` field offset (see the [_B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneity section](#b0InhomoIntro), but is shown as such for learning purposes. The sample is shown as a circle in [](#b0Plot8). As the frequency is not at the [Larmor frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_precession), phase accumulation is observed at the different echo times and a phase difference map can be computed. The _B_{sub}`0` field map is then calculated using the echo times. Note that if {math}`\Delta`TE is too long, the phase could make more than a half revolution between the two echo times resulting in an erroneous _B_{sub}`0` field estimation. This is because phase is defined over {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi` and the sampled points should respect the [Nyquist criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency). In practice, this example field (constant offset) could easily be corrected by adjusting the transmit and receive frequency of the scanner.

## Multi Frequency Population


A brain dataset is used to show a concrete example of a field map that could be acquired in practice. [](#b0Plot9) shows two phase images where phase accumulation is shown due to frequency offsets that vary spatially. As mentioned previously, phase wraps are visible where phase transitions from  {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi` and will be discussed in more detail in the next chapter. The phase difference and _B_{sub}`0` field maps are also shown. Note that taking the phase difference eliminates the wraps in this example, however, there could be residual wraps when the field is more inhomogeneous.

## Benefits and Pitfalls


When acquiring a field mapping sequence, many parameters will affect the resulting images. A minimum of two phase images is required to compute _B_{sub}`0` field maps, as the initial phase {math}`\phi_{0}\left( x,y,z \right)` is generally not known and non-zero. Multi-echo field mapping with more than two echoes will be discussed in the the advanced [_B_{sub}`0` mapping section](#b0MultiEcho). 

These phase maps can be acquired by many sequences. The general principle includes the use of sequences that cause accumulation of phase. This can be done using GRE sequences or using spin-echo sequences with asymmetric echoes (e.g.: first echo at the spin echo and second echo shifted by 1-2 ms to create an accumulation of phase caused by _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities). The sequence parameters are chosen such that the data does not suffer much from distortions and other artifacts caused by _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities. High bandwidth, thin slices and multi-shot sequences are therefore preferred [@Akcakaya2022-xw]. This means EPI sequences are generally not used for field mapping because of their sensitivity to _B_{sub}`0` inhomogeneities. 

When acquiring multiple echoes, the readout direction of the even echoes can be chosen to either be in the same direction (monopolar) as the odd echoes or in opposite directions (bipolar). Using opposite directions can slightly reduce TE, but doing so can cause a slight misregistration between the even and odd echoes and we therefore recommend using readouts in the same direction. 

The standard deviation of the phase ({math}`\sigma_{phase}`) is inversely proportional to the SNR of the magnitude image (SNR{sub}`mag`) [@Brown2014-mv].

```{math}
:label: b0Eq7
:enumerator:5.7
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{phase}=\frac{1}{\text{SNR}_{mag}}
\end{equation}
```

A high SNR image will therefore provide a more reliable phase image. With this in mind, the main parameters to choose are the echo times. The first echo time is usually chosen to be quite fast to maximize SNR and minimize phase wraps. The choice of the second echo time is then chosen according to many factors. i) Fat has ~3.35 ppm frequency offset from water. This can cause errors in the fieldmap measurement, where a chemical shift is mistaken for a field shift near and within fatty tissues. {math}`\Delta`TE can be chosen so that fat and water are in phase and reduce this problem (~2.34ms at 3T). Note that different fat components have different chemical shifts. These values are given as first estimates. ii) Longer {math}`\Delta`TE maximizes the difference between the phase measurements and can provide a better estimate if SNR is still sufficient. iii) Shorter {math}`\Delta`TE minimizes the number of wraps and therefore reduces errors due to unwrapping. If the field offset is known, a maximum {math}`\Delta`TE can be calculated to yield no phase wrapping.

As echoes are usually acquired in rapid successions to avoid phase wrapping, rapid gradient switching is required which leads to [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) that can impact the acquired phase data. To mitigate the issue, a single echo per RF pulse can be acquired. A dual-echo sequence would have twice the number of RF pulses (alternating between acquiring both echoes) but allows slower gradient switching and removes [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) effects from the gradient work of the first echo on the second echo. However, this technique requires longer scan time.

As seen in this section, phase wrapping can be an issue, as phase is defined over {math}`2\pi`. The next section deals with this problem.

(phaseUnwrapIntro)=
# Phase Unwrapping


Phase unwrapping stems from the fact that phase can only be measured over the range of {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi`. If the measured phase crosses from {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi`, a ‚Äúwrap‚Äù is observed as a {math}`2\pi` jump where in reality, the phase was smoothly varying. In the context of MRI, phase wrapping occurs when measuring phase data that varies by more than {math}`2\pi`  within the region of interest. In reality, the number of rotations that a spin can have done is not limited to a single revolution. To accurately recover the true phase information, unwrapping is necessary.

There are two main families of unwrapping techniques. Temporal unwrapping techniques use temporal information from different phase time points and the assumption that the difference between time points is smoothly varying (offset less than ) to correct for phase jumps that can occur in time. Spatial unwrapping uses spatial information and relies on the fact that neighboring voxels should be smoothly varying to identify and correct for {math}`2\pi`  jumps. 

## Temporal Unwrapping



Temporal unwrapping uses multiple time points (>=2) to unwrap the image. By acquiring phase data that vary by at most {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi`, the difference between 2 echoes (using complex difference) yields an unwrapped image free of wraps. Eq. 1 describes the field offset ({math}`\Delta f_{0}`) experienced during {math}`\Delta`TE in the presence of field inhomogeneities.


```{math}
:label: b0Eq8
:enumerator:5.8
\begin{equation}
\Delta f_{0}\left( \textbf{r} \right)=\frac{\gamma}{2\pi}\Delta B_{0}\left( \textbf{r}\text{,}\Delta \text{TE} \right)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\Delta\phi\left( \textbf{r}\text{,}\Delta \text{TE} \right)}{\Delta \text{TE} }
\end{equation}
```


If we assume a maximum field offset {math}`\Delta f_{0,max}` of 1 ppm at 3T (~127 MHz), we can calculate a maximum field offset ({math}`\Delta f_{0,max}`) of 1 ¬µT or 127 Hz. The [Nyquist criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency) can be used to calculate the maximum echo time difference (TE) required to satisfy the no-wrapping requirement in the phase difference image ({math}`\Delta \text{TE} = \left( \Delta f_{0,max} \right)^{-1}`). [](#b0Table1) shows TE for multiple field strength assuming inhomogeneities of 1 ppm. As shown, the echo spacing is _B_{sub}`0` dependent, as higher field offsets are observed at higher field strengths.

```{list-table}  Maximum echo time required to respect the Nyquist criteria for different field strengths for ŒîB0 of 1 ppm.

If a longer TE is selected, or if the inhomogeneities are bigger than originally anticipated in some parts of the image, the phase difference image could also have wraps, and spatial unwrapping would be necessary.

Temporal unwrapping can also be performed without phase difference. [](#b0Plot10) shows the phase of a voxel acquired at four echo times in blue. Note that the last echo time is wrapped (i.e.: the phase rotated by more than {math}`2\pi` and ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù to the positive side). With the assumption that phase does not vary by more than {math}`2\pi`, we can unwrap the phase by, in this case, subtracting {math}`2\pi` from the acquired phase to recover the true phase (in red). A linear fit is shown in green. Note that the slope would represent the field map value.

## Spatial Unwrapping


Spatial unwrapping uses the spatial characteristics of images to unwrap the data. The wrapped image should vary smoothly. Spatial unwrapping typically uses a  region-growing algorithm which identifies and rectifies where there are offsets greater than {math}`2\pi`. An example of a 1D signal of a linearly evolving phase is shown in [](#b0Plot11) to illustrate the phase that we would want to recover from the wrapped phase that would be acquired through space.

:::

A more complex example is shown in [](#b0Plot12) where phase varies spatially in a non-linear fashion. When the signal is unwrapped, different solutions are expected. These solutions vary by {math}`2n\pi`. Its cause and potential remedy are described in the following section.

A more complex example of a signal wrapped and unwrapped. Note that three possibilities are possible when unwrapping, depending on which part of the signal is selected to be the true phase. The slider can be moved left to right to show the wrapped and unwrapped data.
:::

A common issue with spatial unwrapping which stems from region growing algorithms is that the region of interest needs to be defined in a single region, or there can be a {math}`2n\pi` offset between regions. Moreover, region growing algorithms usually require thresholding so that noise is not unwrapped.

A 2D example of wrapped and unwrapped simulated data is shown in [](#b0Plot13). The concept can be expanded to 3D data as well. Note that more wraps result in higher field inhomogeneity.

## Phase unwrapping ambiguity

There is ambiguity to unwrapping and a choice needs to be made regarding the true signal (see [](#b0Plot12)). If the wrong one is selected, this creates a {math}`2n\pi` offset from the true phase. When unwrapping a single phase volume, an educated guess can be made by calculating the average phase in the ROI and expect that to be close to 0 (we assume here that a good frequency shim was first performed in the ROI). n is chosen and the {math}`2n\pi` offset is removed from the unwrapped phase map such that the average phase in the ROI is close to 0. Note that this is not a perfectly robust solution because phase is also affected by other factors such as the receive coil, RF pulse and [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) which could cause the average phase offset to deviate from 0. Fortunately, phase difference images are more reliably unwrapped since some of the phase offsets are constant in both phase images and are removed  when performing the phase difference resulting in a phase offset closer to 0. 

If multiple echoes are acquired, a combination of spatial and temporal unwrapping may be necessary. Multi-echo field mapping is discussed in the following section. Note that with appropriate selections of the echo times, the {math}`2n\pi` offset ambiguity can be remedied. 

## Problematic phase map properties

Phase maps sometimes have wraps that are not possible to unwrap with traditional phase unwrapping techniques. One example is shown in [](#b0Plot14). Phase singularities, also called poles or open ended fringe lines, hinder the abilities of unwrappers to get an accurate unwrapped phase. As can be seen in the following figure, there are two points where the phase is ambiguous. When unwrapping spatially, if two points are selected arbitrarily in the ROI, one would expect that all possible paths linking both points to cross the same number of wraps. Otherwise, crossing a different number of wraps results in ambiguous phase values. Counting wraps can be done by counting the sharp phase transitions where {math}`-\pi` to {math}`+\pi` (black to white) results in +1 wrap and {math}`+\pi` to {math}`-\pi` (white to black) results -1 wrap. However, phase singularities create paths that have a different number of wrap crossings, resulting in ambiguous phase values. [](#b0Plot14) is used as an example to illustrate the above statements. When unwrapping from point A to B, the left path crosses no wraps and would therefore expect the phase to go from {math}`3/4\pi` to {math}`-3/4\pi`, however, the right path crosses a wrap and would therefore expect to go from {math}`3/4\pi` to {math}`-3/4\pi+2\pi`. This is problematic as the phase becomes ambiguous. Phase singularities are usually a result of a poor coil combination process. There are some techniques to mitigate the issue, but the main solution is to correctly combine the coil maps to avoid the singularities altogether.

## Software

Laplacian unwrapping can be very robust even with highly wrapped images but does so at the expense of accuracy. It typically unwraps with an error of low spatial variability. This can be a perfectly reasonable unwrapping technique for some applications such as QSM where the background field (low spatial variability) is subsequently removed. However, in applications such as shimming or qMRI where the accuracy is important, Laplacian unwrapping is not recommended.

Other unwrapping algorithms and softwares are listed below.

# Advanced B0 Mapping Methods

Although dual-echo field mapping can be used for many applications, more advanced _B_{sub}`0` mapping techniques are available depending on the use-case. Multi-echo field mapping, which makes use of more echoes, can be used to increase the accuracy of the computed field map. This can be useful for qMRI, shimming, or QSM, where the goal is to gather field information to map the susceptibility of the tissues. QSM is sensitive to small local variations, therefore a more accurate approach can be beneficial. This section also discusses fast _B_{sub}`0` field mapping in the context of capturing _B_{sub}`0` variations due to air differences generated by breathing. _B_{sub}`0` maps can be affected by [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) and [a section](#b0Eddy) is dedicated to their reduction.

(b0MultiEcho)=
## Multi-echo B0 mapping

Multi-echo field mapping (three or more echoes) makes use of more echo times than the dual-echo standard field map. With more time points, the field maps can be expected to be more accurate. All [benefits and pitfalls of dual echo _B_{sub}`0`](#b0DualEchoBenPit) mapping apply in multi-echo field mapping, with the added criteria that the later echoes should have enough signal to provide a benefit to the technique. As seen in the [dual echo B0 mapping section](#b0DualEcho), the phase generally evolves linearly with respect to time. Another way to look at _B_{sub}`0` field mapping is realizing that we are looking for how much the phase changes per unit time (i.e.: the slope).

```{math}
:label: b0Eq9
:enumerator:5.9
\begin{equation}
\phi\left( \textbf{r}\text{,}t \right)=\phi_{0}\left( \textbf{r}\right)+\gamma \Delta B_{0}\left( \textbf{r} \right)\cdot t
\end{equation}
```

There are many ways to perform multi-echo field mapping. The most straightforward way (after dual-echo) is to spatially unwrap the phase of all the echo times, then temporally unwrap the resulting data to remove any {math}`2n\pi` offsets between time points that could arise from spatial unwrapping. A linear fit can then be done to retrieve the field map. This technique requires the echo times between time points to be reasonably short so that temporal unwrapping can accurately unwrap the data ({math}`\Delta \phi < \pi `). [](#b0Plot15) shows two solutions that can be obtained from this processing (note the exact {math}`2\pi` difference at each timepoint). The difference could be explained from the choice of seed voxel used for unwrapping spatially. However, as the slope (change in phase over time) is the same for both solutions, an accurate field map can still be recovered even if the underlying phase maps have a {math}`2n\pi` offset. This is another advantage over phase difference algorithms.

:::

Another way to perform multi-echo field mapping is to have two echoes that are relatively close to avoid temporal phase wrapping and a later echo with sufficient SNR. The first two echoes can be treated as a dual-echo and the resulting field map can help temporally unwrap the 3rd echo. This 3rd echo can be used to get a better fit. This is shown in [](#b0PLot16).

:enumerator: 5.16
Three-echo acquisition, where the first two echoes respect the [Nyquist criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency) and can be temporally unwrapped accurately, while the third echo has a much longer echo time. The first two echoes can be used to predict the number of wraps of the third echo. With all three echoes accurately unwrapped, a fit with three echoes can be computed.
:::

As mentioned in the [phase unwrapping section](#phaseUnwrapIntro), the standard deviation of the phase is inversely proportional to the SNR of the magnitude image of the field mapping acquisition. This means that longer echo times can have a detrimental impact on the field map if it is not accounted for. One way to address the issue is to weigh the contribution of the echoes by the SNR of the magnitude images.

More complex algorithms such as UMPIRE [24] exploit echo timings to only rely on temporal unwrapping to unwrap the phase images. A minimum of three echoes is necessary for this algorithm. With three echoes, the two echo time differences (ŒîTE{sub}`1`=TE{sub}`2`-TE{sub}`1`, ŒîTE{sub}`2`=TE{sub}`3`-TE{sub}`2`) are chosen to be slightly different. Doing this allows us to calculate the accrued phase during TE{sub}`2`-TE{sub}`1`= Œ¥TE which is chosen to be small and is therefore free of wraps. Using this, the wraps in the different echoes can be estimated and removed yielding unwrapped phase images which can be fit to calculate the field map. An advantage of the technique is that it allows us to select echo times that would normally be too long, as ŒîTE{sub}`x` can be larger than {math}`\pi`. An important prerequisite of this algorithm is that the phase offset occurring during Œ¥TE should be less than  but greater than zero, such that a good estimate of the phase can still be calculated. [](#b0Plot17) shows an example of a single voxel being unwrapped using UMPIRE. As previously stated, the slope of the linear fit is proportional to the resulting field map. The traces can be toggled on and off by clicking the legend.

Although UMPIRE has many advantages, it suffers from being susceptible to noise. [](#b0Plot18) uses the same phase data as the previous figure, but adds a slider that simulates a phase offset added to the second echo.

:::

Unwrappers, such as PRELUDE [@Jenkinson2003-vy] are less susceptible to noise, but do not have the ability to resolve {math}`>\pi` phase offsets between timepoints and can take longer to unwrap the data. The SEGUE [@Karsa2019-rd] algorithm performs similarly to PRELUDE but can be much faster. ROMEO [@Dymerska2021-kq] is also an algorithm that is quite fast and has been shown to perform better than PRELUDE and BEST PATH[@Abdul-Rahman2007-pv] with noise.

(b0Eddy)=
## Reducing eddy currents

Up to this point we have assumed that the phase changes linearly with time. However, this is not always the case. [Eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) can be generated inside the ROI when gradients are changed rapidly. These decaying [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) create a spatially and temporally varying field that can therefore be different depending on the echo time. As the [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) are not constant, they do not cancel out when computing a phase difference. Longer TRs can help minimize [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) and avoid the issue. For smaller TRs, it is possible to acquire the same acquisition twice with the frequency, phase and slice encoding directions reversed. This has the effect of reversing the [eddy currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current) polarity. The field map for each acquisition can be computed and then averaged to minimize their effect.

## Realtime B0 mapping

Specific applications impose constraints that can make field mapping protocols different. One such application is to acquire field maps as close to real-time as possible to characterize the effect of respiration on the field through time. The constraint is therefore to acquire a field map in much less time than a respiration cycle. To save some time, the association of the field with time can be done by acquiring slices one at a time. A 2D scan is therefore preferable in this case, as the slice timing can be associated with the field of the slice rather than using the volume time and the entire volume. An EPI can be used to acquire a field map much faster than a standard gradient-echo. However, as mentioned previously, the distortions might not make this a suitable solution. A 2D dual-echo gradient-echo can be used with minimum TR. Short TEs and RF pulses are also preferable to again reduce the TEs and the TR.
