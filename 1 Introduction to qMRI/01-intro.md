This section starts by explaining the distinction between MRI and quantitative MRI (qMRI), which is of essence to the central premise of this MOOC. 

Next, it aims at delivering an intuitive understanding of how MRI works by using cartoons, simulations and example applications, all introduced in the context of overarching concepts from physics and everyday life.

After covering the basics of MRI, the relationship between data acquisition and parameter estimation will be explained based on two basic qMRI applications: T1 and T2 mapping. 

Finally, we will look at three aspects of qMRI that need to be improved for clinical translation.
