              observed in tissues in vivo using NMR saturation transfer methods.
              Exchange between these two pools was demonstrated by a decrease in
              the steady-state magnetization and relaxation times of 1Hf with
              radiofrequency irradiation of 1Hr. The pseudo-first-order rate
              constant for the movement of magnetization from 1Hf to 1Hr was
              approximately 1 s-1 in kidney and approximately 3 s-1 in skeletal
              muscle in vivo. Proton NMR imaging demonstrated that this exchange
              was tissue specific and generated a novel form of NMR image
              contrast. The extent of exchange between 1Hf and 1Hr as well as
              the topological correlation of the exchange with relaxation
              weighted images suggests that this pathway is a major determinant
              of the observed relaxation properties of water 1H in vivo.",

              saturation-index (MTsat) measurements. METHODS: We developed and
              deployed a vendor-neutral 3D spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequence
              on three clinical scanners by two MRI vendors. We then acquired T1
              maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as well as T1, MTR, and
              MTsat maps in three healthy participants. We performed
              hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to characterize the
              differences between scanners when the vendor-neutral sequence is
              used instead of commercial vendor implementations. Inter-vendor
              deviations were compared for statistical significance to test the
              hypothesis. RESULTS: In the phantom, the vendor-neutral sequence
              reduced inter-vendor differences from 8\% to 19.4\% to 0.2\% to
              5\% with an overall accuracy improvement, reducing ground truth T1
              deviations from 7\% to 11\% to 0.2\% to 4\%. In vivo, we found
              that the variability between vendors is significantly reduced (p =
              0.015) for all maps (T1, MTR, and MTsat) using the vendor-neutral

              are feasible and compatible with clinical MRI scanners. The
              significant reduction of inter-vendor variability using
              vendor-neutral sequences has important implications for qMRI

              protocols, particularly those that include whole-brain T1 mapping
              using the variable flip angle (VFA) technique. However, B1 mapping
              sequences are not typically available on many magnetic resonance
              imaging (MRI) scanners. The aim of this work was to demonstrate
              that B1 mapping implemented using standard scanner product pulse
              sequences can produce B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps comparable in quality
              and acquisition time to advanced techniques. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Six healthy subjects were scanned at 3.0T. An interleaved
              multislice spin-echo echo planar imaging double-angle (EPI-DA) B1
              mapping protocol, using a standard product pulse sequence, was
              compared to two alternative methods (actual flip angle imaging,
              AFI, and Bloch-Siegert shift, BS). Single-slice spin-echo DA B1
              maps were used as a reference for comparison (Ref. DA). VFA flip
              angles were scaled using each B1 map prior to fitting T1 ; the
              nominal flip angle case was also compared. RESULTS: The
              pooled-subject voxelwise correlation (ρ) for B1 maps
              (BS/AFI/EPI-DA) relative to the reference B1 scan (Ref. DA) were ρ
              = 0.92/0.95/0.98. VFA T1 correlations using these maps were ρ =
              0.86/0.88/0.96, much better than without B1 correction (ρ = 0.53).
              The relative error for each B1 map (BS/AFI/EPI-DA/Nominal) had
              95th percentiles of 5/4/3/13\%. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that
              B1 mapping implemented using product pulse sequences can provide
              excellent quality B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps, comparable to other
              custom techniques. This fast whole-brain measurement (∼2 min) can

              (MRI). These changes are indicative of demyelination and
              remyelination. This technique comprises a definition of ΔMTR
              lesions, which are identified directly from the MTR images, and an
              automatic procedure for segmenting these lesions. We used this
              technique to analyze MTR changes in lesions of subjects with
              rapidly progressing multiple sclerosis before and after treatment
              with immunoablation and autologous stem cell transplant. Subjects
              who experienced clinical improvement after treatment showed
              significantly improved MTR recovery in lesions that were
              recovering during treatment (p<0.0001) while those who were
              clinically stable after treatment showed significantly poorer MTR
              recovery (p=0.002). The statistical power of this technique to
              detect treatment effects on MTR recovery was shown to be
              considerably better than previous methods. These results suggest
              that longitudinal measurements of MTR in ΔMTR lesions may be an
              important technique for the assessment of treatment effects on
              remyelination in clinical trials.",

              inter-site comparability is still controversial for conventional
              anatomical T1-weighted MRI data. Quantitative multi-parameter
              mapping (MPM) was designed to provide MR parameter measures that
              are comparable across sites and time points, i.e., 1 mm
              high-resolution maps of the longitudinal relaxation rate (R1 =
              1/T1), effective proton density (PD(*)), magnetization transfer
              saturation (MT) and effective transverse relaxation rate (R2(*) =
              1/T2(*)). MPM was validated at 3T for use in multi-center studies
              by scanning five volunteers at three different sites. We
              determined the inter-site bias, inter-site and intra-site
              coefficient of variation (CoV) for typical morphometric measures
              [i.e., gray matter (GM) probability maps used in voxel-based
              morphometry] and the four quantitative parameters. The inter-site
              bias and CoV were smaller than 3.1 and 8\%, respectively, except
              for the inter-site CoV of R2(*) (<20\%). The GM probability maps
              based on the MT parameter maps had a 14\% higher inter-site
              reproducibility than maps based on conventional T1-weighted
              images. The low inter-site bias and variance in the parameters and
              derived GM probability maps confirm the high comparability of the
              quantitative maps across sites and time points. The reliability,
              short acquisition time, high resolution and the detailed insights
              into the brain microstructure provided by MPM makes it an
              efficient tool for multi-center imaging studies.",

              myelin-sensitive magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) or saturation
              (MTsat), axon-sensitive water diffusion Neurite Orientation
              Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI), and the aggregate g-ratio,
              may provide more specific markers of white matter integrity than
              conventional MRI for early patient stratification in
              relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The aim of this
              study was to determine the sensitivity of such markers to
              longitudinal pathological change within cerebral white matter
              lesions (WML) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in recently
              diagnosed RRMS. Methods Seventy-nine people with recently
              diagnosed RRMS, from the FutureMS longitudinal cohort, were
              recruited to an extended MRI protocol at baseline and one year
              later. Twelve healthy volunteers received the same MRI protocol,
              repeated within two weeks. Ethics approval and written informed
              consent were obtained. 3T MRI included magnetisation transfer, and
              multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging. NAWM and whole brain were
              segmented from 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE, and WML from T2-weighted
              FLAIR. MTR, MTsat, NODDI isotropic (ISOVF) and intracellular
              (ICVF) volume fractions, and g-ratio (calculated from MTsat and
              NODDI data) were measured within WML and NAWM. Brain parenchymal
              fraction (BPF) was also calculated. Longitudinal change in BPF and
              microstructural metrics was assessed with paired t-tests (α =
              0.05) and linear mixed models, adjusted for confounding factors
              with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple
              comparisons. Longitudinal changes were compared with test-retest
              Bland-Altman limits of agreement from healthy control white
              matter. The influence of longitudinal change on g-ratio was
              explored through post-hoc analysis in silico by computing g-ratio
              with realistic simulated MTsat and NODDI values. Results In NAWM,
              g-ratio and ICVF increased, and MTsat decreased over one year
              (adjusted mean difference = 0.007, 0.005, and −0.057 respectively,
              all FDR-corrected p < 0.05). There was no significant change in
              MTR, ISOVF, or BPF. In WML, MTsat, NODDI ICVF and ISOVF increased
              over time (adjusted mean difference = 0.083, 0.024 and 0.016,
              respectively, all FDR-corrected p < 0.05). Group-level
              longitudinal changes exceeded test-retest limits of agreement for
              NODDI ISOVF and ICVF in WML only. In silico analysis showed
              g-ratio may increase due to a decrease in MTsat or ISOVF, or an
              increase in ICVF. Discussion G-ratio and MTsat changes in NAWM
              over one year may indicate subtle myelin loss in early RRMS, which
              were not apparent with BPF or NAWM MTR. Increases in NAWM and WML
              NODDI ICVF were not anticipated, and raise the possibility of
              axonal swelling or morphological change. Increases in WML MTsat
              may reflect myelin repair. Changes in NODDI ISOVF are more likely
              to reflect alterations in water content. Competing MTsat and ICVF
              changes may account for the absence of g-ratio change in WML.
              Longitudinal changes in microstructural measures are significant
              at a group level, however detection in individual patients in
              early RRMS is limited by technique reproducibility. Conclusion
              MTsat and g-ratio are more sensitive than MTR to early
              pathological changes in RRMS, but complex dependence of g-ratio on
              NODDI parameters limit the interpretation of aggregate measures in
              isolation. Improvements in technique reproducibility and
              validation of MRI biophysical models across a range of
              pathological tissue states are needed.",
