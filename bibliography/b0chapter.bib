              Magnetic-susceptibility artifacts were studied in a phantom model
              and the results were compared to MR images obtained in clinical
              cases. FINDINGS: Artifacts manifested themselves as regions of
              focal fat-suppression failure and appeared as bright signals
              without geometric distortions at magnetic-susceptibility
              interfaces along the static field (z) direction. The location and
              extent of these artifacts were independent of either frequency or
              phase-encoding direction and are different from those observed in
              gradient-echo images. CONCLUSIONS: In representative clinical MR
              exams, these artifacts were identified in the high nasopharynx and
              low orbit and should not be misinterpreted as pathology.",

              has been proposed for multicomponent T2* (MC T2*) based myelin
              water fraction (MWF) mapping. This approach has appeal because it
              can provide fast whole-brain coverage, has low specific absorption
              rate, and short echo spacing. However, the MGRE signal requires
              correction for accurate MWF mapping, because of its sensitivity to
              magnetic field inhomogeneities (ΔB0 ). We propose a ΔB0 correction
              method for 2D MGRE data obtained for MWF mapping. THEORY AND
              METHODS: Latter-echo MGRE data were fit to estimate B0 gradients
              in the slice-select direction ( Gz). The decay signal was
              corrected for the effects of Gz, and MC T2* analysis was performed
              using nonnegative least-squares fitting. The method was evaluated
              using simulations and its performance demonstrated in healthy
              volunteers. RESULTS: Simulations showed that MWFs are
              significantly biased in the presence of Gz and that our correction
              method leads to accurate MWF estimates. In vivo MWF maps obtained
              from corrected data showed recovery of MWF estimates in areas of
              high ΔB0, and overall good agreement with literature values
              obtained with the reference MC T2-based method. CONCLUSION: A new
              algorithm was presented for ΔB0 correction of 2D MGRE echo data
              acquired for MWF imaging. Simulations and in vivo data showed an
              improvement in MWF estimates. Magn Reson Med 78:49-57, 2017. ©

              phase to reveal disease-related changes in tissue composition,
              including iron or calcium content. The MRI phase is also routinely
              used in functional and diffusion MRI for distortion correction.
              However, phase images are wrapped into a range of 2π radians.
              Phase region expanding labeller for unwrapping discrete estimates
              (PRELUDE) is the gold standard method for robust, spatial, 3-D,
              MRI phase unwrapping. Unfortunately, PRELUDE's computation time
              can reach 15 min for a severely wrapped brain image and nearly 10
              h to unwrap a full head-and-neck image on a standard PC. In this
              paper, we develop a Speedy rEgion-Growing algorithm for Unwrapping
              Estimated phase (SEGUE) based on similar principles to PRELUDE,
              implemented with additional methods for acceleration. We compared
              PRELUDE and SEGUE in numerical phantoms, and using in vivo images
              of the brain, head and neck, and pelvis acquired in 4-5 healthy
              volunteers and at 4-6 echo times. To overcome
              chemical-shift-induced errors within the head and neck, and pelvic
              images, we also investigated applying both techniques within fat
              and water masks separately. SEGUE provided almost identical
              unwrapped phase maps to the gold standard PRELUDE. SEGUE was (1.5
              to 70 times) faster than PRELUDE, especially in severely wrapped
              images at later echoes and in the head and neck, and pelvic
              images. Applying these techniques within fat and water masks
              separately removed chemical-shift-induced errors successfully.
              SEGUE's MATLAB implementation is available for download. SEGUE is
              a general unwrapping algorithm not specific to MRI, and therefore
              could be used in images acquired with other modalities.",

              remaining errors by means of hardware, sequence, or signal

              correction, while the measured vCBV was substantially reduced

              2.68 +/- 0.47\% were obtained by the two different DeltaB
              correction methods, in excellent agreement with the reported
              results in the literature. Furthermore, when MR\_OEF was compared
              with and without DeltaB correction, no significant differences (P
              = 0.467) were observed. The ability to simultaneously obtain vCBV

              temporal phase evolution. This information is combined to form a
              quality map that guides the unwrapping along a 3D path through the
              object using a computationally efficient minimum spanning tree
              algorithm. ROMEO was tested against the two most commonly used
              exact phase-unwrapping methods, PRELUDE and BEST PATH, in
              simulated topographies and at several field strengths: in 3T and
              7T in vivo human head images and 9.4T ex vivo rat head images.
              RESULTS: ROMEO was more reliable than PRELUDE and BEST PATH,
              yielding unwrapping results with excellent temporal stability for
              multi-echo or multi-time-point data. It does not require image
              masking and delivers results within seconds, even in large, highly
              wrapped multi-echo data sets (eg, 9 seconds for a 7T head data set
              with 31 echoes and a 208 × 208 × 96 matrix size). CONCLUSION:
              Overall, ROMEO was both faster and more accurate than PRELUDE and
              BEST PATH, delivering exact results within seconds, which is well
              below typical image acquisition times, enabling potential
              on-console application.",

              shown that intense gradient utilization in clinical
              horizontal-bore superconducting MR scanners of three different
              vendors results in main magnetic fields that vary on a long time
              scale both spatially and temporally by amounts of order 0.8-2.5
              ppm. The observed spatial changes have linear and quadratic
              variations that are strongest along the z direction. It is shown
              that the effect of such variations is of sufficient magnitude to
              completely obfuscate thermal phase shifts measured by
              proton-resonance frequency-shift MR thermometry and certainly

               multi-echo scans that works even where there are several wraps
               between echoes, and which generates unwrapped phase images in
               addition to phase difference (PD) images. THEORY: The difference
               between the echo spacings in an acquisition with three unevenly
               spaced echoes (an imposed delay) can be selected such that the
               phase evolution in that time is in the range -π to +π in all
               voxels of interest. Under this condition, an image of the
               difference between the phase evolutions in the two inter-echo
               periods, an estimate of ΔB0 , is free of wraps. This ΔB0 estimate
               can be used to identify and remove receiver phase offsets and
               wraps in phase images. METHODS: The approach was tested on
               simulated data and high-resolution in vivo brain data acquired
               from six subjects at 7 Tesla. RESULTS: The method generated
               wrap-free phase images. It was able to remove more wraps than is
               possible with PD imaging and was faster and more reliable than
               spatial unwrapping. CONCLUSION: Unwrapping Multi-echo Phase
               Images with iRregular Echo spacings (UMPIRE) is conceptually
               simple, fast, reliable, and requires no fitting, thresholds, or

              METHODS: We used deep learning to segment the optic disc, fovea,
              and vessels in fundus photographs, and measured pallor. We
              assessed the relationship between pallor and pRNFL thickness
              derived from optical coherence tomography scans in 118
              participants. Separately, we used images diagnosed by clinical
              inspection as pale (n = 45) and assessed how measurements compared
              with healthy controls (n = 46). We also developed automatic
              rejection thresholds and tested the software for robustness to
              camera type, image format, and resolution. RESULTS: We developed
              software that automatically quantified disc pallor across several
              zones in fundus photographs. Pallor was associated with pRNFL
              thickness globally (β = -9.81; standard error [SE] = 3.16; P <
              0.05), in the temporal inferior zone (β = -29.78; SE = 8.32; P <
              0.01), with the nasal/temporal ratio (β = 0.88; SE = 0.34; P <
              0.05), and in the whole disc (β = -8.22; SE = 2.92; P < 0.05).
              Furthermore, pallor was significantly higher in the patient group.
              Last, we demonstrate the analysis to be robust to camera type,
              image format, and resolution. CONCLUSIONS: We developed software
              that automatically locates and quantifies disc pallor in fundus
              photographs and found associations between pallor measurements and
              pRNFL thickness. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We think our method will

              diseases characterized by disc pallor and optic atrophy, including
              glaucoma, compression, and potentially in neurodegenerative

              magnetic field of the scanner; materials with the second kind of
              magnetic field compatibility meet the more demanding requirement
              that they produce only negligible artifacts within the MR image
              and their effect on the positional accuracy of features within the
              image is negligible or can readily be corrected. Several materials
              exhibiting magnetic field compatibility of the second kind have
              been studied and a group of materials that produce essentially no
              image distortion, even when located directly within the imaging
              field of view, is identified. Because of demagnetizing effects,
              the shape and orientation, as well as the susceptibility, of
              objects within and adjacent to the imaging region is important in
              MRI. The quantitative use of susceptibility data is important to
              MRI, but the use of literature values for the susceptibility of
              materials is often difficult because of inconsistent traditions in
              the definitions and units used for magnetic
              parameters-particularly susceptibility. The uniform use of SI
              units for magnetic susceptibility and related quantities would
              help to achieve consistency and avoid confusion in MRI.",
