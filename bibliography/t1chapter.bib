              Clinical DCE-MRI datasets of 23 patients with HN tumors were
              included in this study. T1 maps were generated based on
              multiple-flip-angle (MFA) method and different DFA combinations.
              Tofts model parameter maps of k(ep), K(trans) and v(p) based on
              MFA and DFAs were calculated and compared. Fitted parameter by MFA
              and DFAs were quantitatively evaluated in primary tumor, salivary

              remarkable kinetic parameter estimation deviations in head and
              neck tissues. In particular, the DFA of [2º, 7º] overestimated,
              while [7º, 12º] and [7º, 15º] underestimated K(trans) and v(p),
              significantly (P<0.01). [2º, 15º] achieved the smallest but still

              by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as a tool to noninvasively
              evaluate cartilage material and biochemical properties. The
              specific objective was to answer two questions: (1) does cartilage
              initial elastic modulus (E 0) correlate with T1ρ dispersion
              effects and (2) does collagen or proteoglycan content correlate
              with T1ρ dispersion effects? DESIGN: Cadaveric patellae with and
              without visible cartilage damage on conventional MR were included.
              T2 and T1ρ relaxation times at 500 and 1000 Hz spin-lock field
              amplitudes were measured. We estimated T1ρ dispersion effects by
              measuring T1ρ relaxation time at 500 and 1000 Hz and T2 relaxation
              time and using a new tool, the ratio T1ρ/T2. Cartilage initial
              elastic modulus, E 0, was measured from initial response of
              mechanical indentation creep tests. Collagen and proteoglycan
              contents were measured at the indentation test sites; proteoglycan
              content was measured by their covalently linked sulfated
              glycosaminoglycans (sGAG). Pearson correlation coefficients were
              determined, taking into account the clustering of multiple samples
              within a single patella specimen. RESULTS: Cartilage initial
              elastic modulus, E 0, increased with decreasing values of T1ρ/T2
              measurements at both 500 Hz (P = 0.034) and 1000 Hz (P = 0.022).
              1/T1ρ relaxation time (500 Hz) increased with increasing sGAG
              content (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: T1ρ/T2 ratio, a new tool, and
              cartilage initial elastic modulus are both measures of
              water-protein interactions, are dependent on the cartilage
              structure, and were correlated in this study.",

              is found promising in various clinical applications. However,

              errors, which remains one of the greatest challenges to adopt this
              technique in routine clinical practice. The conventional
              continuous wave spin-lock is susceptible to B1 radiofrequency (RF)
              and B0 field inhomogeneity, which appears as banding artifacts in
              acquired images. A number of methods have been reported to modify

              exchange in knee cartilage in vivo by R1ρ dispersion analysis.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six healthy subjects (one female and five
              males, age range 24 to 71 y) underwent T1ρ imaging of knee
              cartilage on a 3T MRI scanner. Quantitative estimates of R1ρ
              (=1/T1ρ) were made using 5 different spin-lock durations for each
              of 12 different spin-lock amplitudes over the range 0 to 550Hz.
              When the variations of R1ρ with spin-locking strength (the R1ρ
              dispersion) are dominated by chemical exchange contributions, R1ρ
              dispersion curves can be analyzed to derive quantitative
              characteristics of the exchange and provide information on tissue
              composition. In this work, in vivo R1ρ dispersion of human knee
              articular cartilage at 3T was analyzed, and the exchange rates of
              protons between water and macromolecular hydroxyls (mainly in
              glycosaminoglycans) were estimated based on a theoretical model.
              RESULTS: R1ρ values showed marked dispersion in articular
              cartilage and varied by approximately 50\% between low and high
              values of the locking field, a change much greater than in
              surrounding tissues, consistent with greater contributions from
              chemical exchange. From the theoretical model, the exchange rates
              in cartilage were estimated to be in the range of 1.0-3.0kHz, and
              varied within the tissue. Variations within a single knee appear
              to be larger with increasing age. CONCLUSION: R1ρ dispersion
              analysis may provide more specific information for studying
              cartilage biochemical composition and form the basis for
              quantitative evaluation of cartilage disorders.",

              insights into cardiac disease. Existing methods require long
              breath holds that are demanding for many cardiac patients. In this
              work we propose and validate a novel, clinically applicable, pulse
              sequence for myocardial T1-mapping that is compatible with typical
              limits for end-expiration breath-holding in patients. MATERIALS
              AND METHODS: The Shortened MOdified Look-Locker Inversion recovery
              (ShMOLLI) method uses sequential inversion recovery measurements
              within a single short breath-hold. Full recovery of the
              longitudinal magnetisation between sequential inversion pulses is
              not achieved, but conditional interpretation of samples for
              reconstruction of T1-maps is used to yield accurate measurements,
              and this algorithm is implemented directly on the scanner. We
              performed computer simulations for 100 ms<T1 < 2.7 s and heart
              rates 40-100 bpm followed by phantom validation at 1.5T and 3T.
              In-vivo myocardial T1-mapping using this method and the previous
              gold-standard (MOLLI) was performed in 10 healthy volunteers at
              1.5T and 3T, 4 volunteers with contrast injection at 1.5T, and 4
              patients with recent myocardial infarction (MI) at 3T. RESULTS: We
              found good agreement between the average ShMOLLI and MOLLI
              estimates for T1 < 1200 ms. In contrast to the original method,
              ShMOLLI showed no dependence on heart rates for long T1 values,
              with estimates characterized by a constant 4\% underestimation for
              T1 = 800-2700 ms. In-vivo, ShMOLLI measurements required 9.0 ± 1.1
              s (MOLLI = 17.6 ± 2.9 s). Average healthy myocardial T1 s by
              ShMOLLI at 1.5T were 966 ± 48 ms (mean ± SD) and 1166 ± 60 ms at
              3T. In MI patients, the T1 in unaffected myocardium (1216 ± 42 ms)
              was similar to controls at 3T. Ischemically injured myocardium
              showed increased T1 = 1432 ± 33 ms (p < 0.001). The difference
              between MI and remote myocardium was estimated 15\% larger by
              ShMOLLI than MOLLI (p < 0.04) which suffers from heart rate
              dependencies for long T1. The in-vivo variability within ShMOLLI
              T1-maps was only 14\% (1.5T) or 18\% (3T) higher than the MOLLI
              maps, but the MOLLI acquisitions were twice longer than ShMOLLI
              acquisitions. CONCLUSION: ShMOLLI is an efficient method that
              generates immediate, high-resolution myocardial T1-maps in a short
              breath-hold with high precision. This technique provides a
              valuable clinically applicable tool for myocardial tissue

              Results are also shown demonstrating the utility of this approach

              simulate nonfatty tissues with different macromolecular
              compositions. These measurements were used to verify a signal

              technique implemented on a clinical MR imaging system operating at
              1.5 tesla. Although the oil showed little change in image contrast
              with increasing f1/delta, the two gels demonstrated a strong
              variation which provided improved discrimination compared to
              T1-weighted imaging. Off-resonance spin locking is suggested as a

  abstract = "B1 errors are a problem in magnetization transfer ratio (MTR)
              measurements because the MTR value is dependent on the amplitude
              of the magnetization transfer (MT) pulse. B1 errors can arise from
              radiofrequency (RF) nonuniformity (caused by the RF coil, or skin
              effect and dielectric resonance in the subject's head) and also
              from inaccurate setting of the transmitter output when
              compensating for varying amounts of loading of the RF coil. B1
              errors, and hence MTR errors, may be up to 5-10\%, a large source
              of error in quantitative MR measurements. Radiofrequency
              nonuniformity may cause MTR histograms to be broadened. The
              dependence of MTR on B1 was modeled using binary spin bath theory,
              with a continuous wave (CW) approximation. For B1 reductions of up
              to 20\%, normalized plots for different brain tissue types could
              be approximated by a single line, indicating that a systematic
              correction could be applied to MTR measurements with a known B1
              error, regardless of tissue type. On a 1.5-T scanner with a
              birdcage coil, MTR was measured in 18 tissue types in five
              controls. The MT pulse amplitude was reduced in steps from its
              nominal value by up to 20\%. Averaging data over all controls and
              tissue types resulted in a line fitting
              mtr(normalized)=0.812b(1normalized)+0.193, where mtr(normalized)
              is the normalized value of MTR (relative to its value at the
              nominal B1) and b(1normalized) is the normalized value of B1
              (relative to its nominal value). For a 20\% reduction in MT pulse
              amplitude (i.e., b(1normalized)=0.80), the mean MTR value for the
              18 tissue types was 7.0 percent units (pu) below the correct
              value. After correction using the single equation above for all
              tissue types, all MTR values were within 1.5 pu of their correct
              value [root mean square (rms) error=0.7 pu]. Magnetization
              transfer ratio values tended to be slightly overcorrected because
              the simple linear correction scheme is only an approximation to
              the true MTR dependence on B1. A B1 field mapping technique was
              implemented, based on the double angle method (DAM), with fast
              spin-echo (FSE) readout, and TR=15 s; this took a total of 6 min
              of imaging time. This was used to quantify B(1) errors and correct
              MTR maps and histograms. However, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) T1
              is very long (approximately 4.2 s); thus, to achieve complete
              longitudinal relaxation (a requirement of the DAM B1 mapping
              method), an increase in TR and, hence, acquisition time would be
              required. In general, however, we are not interested in
              calculating the B1 in the CSF, although it is important that the
              B1 is determined in partial volume voxels around the CSF. Using
              our birdcage head coil, whole-brain B1 histograms were found to
              have full-width half maximums (FWHMs) ranging from just 6.8\% to
              11.5\% of the nominal B1 value. The FSE DAM B1 field mapping
              technique was shown to be robust, although a longer TR time may be
              desirable to ensure complete elimination of CSF partial volume
              errors. The procedure can be applied on any scanner where the
              Euro-MT sequence is available, or alternatively, where the
              amplitude of B1 or of the MT pulse can be manually reduced in
              order to perform this type of ``calibration'' experiment for the
              particular MTR sequence used. The MTR is known to be highly
              dependent on the parameters of the sequence used, in particular,
              the MT pulse shape, flip angle, duration, and offset frequency,
              and the repetition time TR' between successive MT pulses.
              Therefore, correction schemes will differ for different MTR
              sequences, and new data sets would be required to calculate these
              different correction schemes.",

              mapping method is presented. The method is based on steady-state

              spoiling or fully refocusing the transverse magnetization
              following each excitation pulse. T(1) is extracted from a pair of

              flip angles. This T(1) information is combined with two refocused
              steady-state free precession (SSFP) images to determine T(2). T(1)
              and T(2) accuracy was evaluated against inversion recovery (IR)
              and spin-echo (SE) results, respectively. Error within the T(1)
              and T(2) maps, determined from both phantom and in vivo
              measurements, is approximately 7\% for T(1) between 300 and 2000
              ms and 7\% for T(2) between 30 and 150 ms. The efficiency of the

              our combined approach represents the most efficient of those
              examined. Acquisition time for a whole brain T(1) map (25 x 25 x
              10 cm) is less than 8 min with 1 mm(3) isotropic voxels. An

              postprocessing time is less than 1 min on a 1 GHz PIII PC. The

              resonance (CMR) is frequently used to evaluate myocardial
              viability, estimate total infarct size and transmurality, but is
              not always straightforward is and contraindicated in patients with
              renal failure because of the risk of nephrogenic systemic
              fibrosis. T2- and T1-weighted CMR alone is however relatively
              insensitive to chronic myocardial infarction (MI) in the absence
              of a contrast agent. The objective of this manuscript is to
              explore T1ρ-weighted rotating frame CMR techniques for infarct
              characterization without contrast agents. We hypothesize that T1ρ
              CMR accurately measures infarct size in chronic MI on account of a
              large change in T1ρ relaxation time between scar and myocardium.
              METHODS: 7Yorkshire swine underwent CMR at 8 weeks post-surgical
              induction of apical or posterolateral myocardial infarction. Late
              gadolinium enhanced and T1ρ CMR were performed at high resolution
              to visualize MI. T1ρ-weighted imaging was performed with a B₁ =
              500 Hz spin lock pulse on a 3 T clinical MR scanner. Following
              sacrifice, the heart was excised and infarct size was calculated
              by optical planimetry. Infarct size was calculated for all three
              methods (LGE, T1ρ and planimetry) and statistical analysis was
              performed. T1ρ relaxation time maps were computed from multiple
              T1ρ-weighted images at varying spin lock duration. RESULTS: Mean
              infarct contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) in LGE and T1ρ CMR was 2.8 ±
              0.1 and 2.7 ± 0.1. The variation in signal intensity of tissues
              was found to be, in order of decreasing signal intensity, LV
              blood, fat and edema, infarct and healthy myocardium. Infarct size
              measured by T1ρ CMR (21.1\% ± 1.4\%) was not significantly
              different from LGE CMR (22.2\% ± 1.5\%) or planimetry (21.1\% ±
              2.7\%; p < 0.05).T1ρ relaxation times were T1ρinfarct = 91.7 ms in
              the infarct and T1ρremote = 47.2 ms in the remote myocardium.
              CONCLUSIONS: T1ρ-weighted imaging using long spin locking pulses
              enables high discrimination between infarct and myocardium. T1ρ
              CMR may be useful to visualizing MI without the need for exogenous
              contrast agents for a wide range of clinical cardiac applications
              such as to distinguish edema and scar tissue and tissue

              T1rho-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment
              of degeneration and proteoglycan content in the human
              intervertebral disc. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Loss of
              proteoglycan in the nucleus pulposus occurs during early
              degeneration. Conventional MRI techniques cannot detect these
              early changes in the extracellular matrix content of the disc.
              T1rho MRI is sensitive to changes in proteoglycan content of
              articular cartilage and may, therefore, be sensitive to
              proteoglycan content in the intervertebral disc. METHODS: Intact
              human cadaveric lumbar spines were imaged on a clinical MR
              scanner. Average T1rho in the nucleus pulposus was calculated from
              quantitative T1rho maps. After MRI, the spines were dissected, and
              proteoglycan content of the nucleus pulposus was measured.
              Finally, the stage of degeneration was graded using conventional
              T2 images. RESULTS: T1rho decreased linearly with increasing
              degeneration (r = -0.76, P < 0.01) and age (r = -0.76, P < 0.01).
              Biochemical analysis revealed a strong linear correlation between
              T1rho and sulfated-glycosaminoglycan content. T1rho was moderately
              correlated with water content. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this
              study suggest that T1rho may provide a tool for the diagnosis of
              early degenerative changes in the disc. T1rho-weighted MRI is a
              noninvasive technique that may provide higher dynamic range than
              T2 and does not require a high static field or exogenous contrast

              consent was obtained. Whole-brain T1 maps were obtained in 67
              patients with MS and 24 healthy control subjects with

              with correction for B(1) imperfections. Analysis of variance was
              performed on T1 histogram parameters of global normal-appearing WM
              and GM. Regional mean T1 values were analyzed with a multilevel
              approach. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to
              investigate associations with clinical disability and overall
              atrophy. For patients, T2 lesion load was determined. RESULTS: T1
              histograms of normal-appearing WM had significantly higher peak
              positions for patients with MS (792 msec +/- 36 in secondary
              progressive [SP] MS) than for control subjects (746 msec +/- 23)
              and were significantly broader and lower (all P < .001).
              Histograms for cortical normal-appearing GM were significantly
              shifted (peak positions, 1263 msec +/- 44 in control subjects and
              1355 msec +/- 62 in patients with SP MS) (P < .001). Histogram
              peak positions were significantly higher in SP MS than in
              relapsing-remitting (RR) and primary progressive MS (P < .05). In
              SP disease, at least 31\% of normal-appearing WM and 20\% of
              cortical normal-appearing GM were affected. In MS, T1 was
              significantly elevated in all normal-appearing WM and cortical
              normal-appearing GM regions (all P < .01) but was elevated only in
              the thalamus in deep GM (P < .05). Cortical T1 histogram peak
              position was associated with clinical disability; T2 lesion load
              was not. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a global disease process
              affects large parts of both normal-appearing WM and GM in MS and
              effects are worse for SP MS than for RR MS.",

              presented. The approach combines a gold standard scanning
              procedure with a novel fitting procedure. Fitting complex data to
              a five-parameter model ensures accuracy and precision of the T(1)
              estimation. A reduced-dimension nonlinear least squares method is
              proposed. This method turns the complicated multi-parameter
              minimization into a straightforward one-dimensional search. As the
              range of possible T(1) values is known, a global grid search can
              be used, ensuring that a global optimal solution is found. When
              only magnitude data are available, the algorithm is adapted to
              concurrently restore polarity. The performance of the new
              algorithm is demonstrated in simulations and phantom experiments.
              The new algorithm is as accurate and precise as the conventionally
              used Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm but much faster. This gain in
              speed makes the use of the five-parameter model viable. In
              addition, the new algorithm does not require initialization of the
              search parameters. Finally, the methodology is applied in vivo to
              conventional brain imaging and to skin imaging. T(1) values are
              estimated for white matter and gray matter at 1.5 T and for
              dermis, hypodermis, and muscle at 1.5 T, 3 T, and 7 T.",

              healthy patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study
              was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Written
              informed consent was obtained. Healthy volunteers (n = 25) and
              patients (n = 34) with cirrhosis underwent whole-liver T1ρ MR
              imaging at 1.5 T. Mean T1ρ values were calculated from liver
              regions of interest. Mean T1ρ values were correlated to clinical
              data and histopathologic analysis by analysis of variance.
              Receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated to
              determine the accuracy of mean T1ρ values for the assessment of
              Child-Pugh class. RESULTS: Mean T1ρ values of volunteers (mean,
              40.9 msec ± 2.9 [standard deviation]; range, 33.9-46.3 msec) were
              significantly lower than those of patients who were Child-Pugh
              class A (P < .004), B (P < .001), or C (P < .001), and significant
              differences were found between each Child-Pugh stage (A vs B, P <
              .002; B vs C, P < .009; A vs C, P < .001). Liver cirrhosis was
              confirmed via histologic analysis in all patients with liver
              biopsy. Mean T1ρ values did not correlate with necroinflammatory
              activity (r = 0.31; P = .23), degree of steatosis (r = -0.016; P =
              .68), or presence of iron load (r = 0.22; P = .43). Mean T1ρ
              values performed well by assessing the Child-Pugh stage, with
              receiver operating characteristic areas of 0.95-0.98. Intraclass
              correlation coefficient values ranged between 0.890 and 0.987,
              which indicated excellent imaging and reimaging reproducibility
              and interobserver and intraobserver variability. CONCLUSION:
              Whole-liver T1ρ MR imaging at 1.5 T to detect and assess human
              liver cirrhosis is feasible. Further investigation and
              optimization of this technique are warranted to cover the entire

              technique was excellent. The coefficient of variation (CV) across
              16 measurements in a head phantom was 2.0\%, compared with a CV of
              2.7\% across 45 separate measurements in a single subject. The

              information that is applicable to numerous clinical and
              neuroscience applications. In this work, we investigated the
              precision of T1 relaxation time as measured using the variable
              flip angle method with emphasis on the noise propagated from
              radiofrequency transmit field ([Formula: see text]) measurements.
              The analytical solution for T1 precision was derived by standard
              error propagation methods incorporating the noise from the three
              input sources: two spoiled gradient echo (SPGR) images and a
              [Formula: see text] map. Repeated in vivo experiments were
              performed to estimate the total variance in T1 maps and we
              compared these experimentally obtained values with the theoretical
              predictions to validate the established theoretical framework.
              Both the analytical and experimental results showed that variance
              in the [Formula: see text] map propagated comparable noise levels
              into the T1 maps as either of the two SPGR images. Improving
              precision of the [Formula: see text] measurements significantly
              reduced the variance in the estimated T1 map. The variance
              estimated from the repeatedly measured in vivoT1 maps agreed well
              with the theoretically-calculated variance in T1 estimates, thus
              validating the analytical framework for realistic in vivo
              experiments. We concluded that for T1 mapping experiments, the
              error propagated from the [Formula: see text] map must be
              considered. Optimizing the SPGR signals while neglecting to
              improve the precision of the [Formula: see text] map may result in
              grossly overestimating the precision of the estimated T1 values.",

              chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) show contrast that
              depends on chemical exchange between water and other protons. In
              addition, spin-lattice relaxation rates in the rotating frame
              (R1ρ) are also affected by exchange, especially at high fields,
              and can be exploited to provide novel, exchange-dependent
              contrast. Here, we evaluate and compare the factors that modulate
              the exchange contrast for these methods using simulations and
              experiments on simple, biologically relevant samples. METHODS:
              Simulations and experimental measurements at 9.4 T of rotating
              frame relaxation rate dispersion and CEST contrast were performed
              on solutions of macromolecules containing amide and hydroxyl
              exchanging protons. RESULTS: The simulations and experimental
              measurements confirm that both CEST and R1ρ measurements depend on
              similar exchange parameters, but they manifest themselves
              differently in their effects on contrast. CEST contrast may be
              larger in the slow and intermediate exchange regimes for protons
              with large resonant frequency offsets (e.g. >2 ppm). Spin-locking
              techniques can produce larger contrast enhancement when resonant
              frequency offsets are small (<2 ppm) and exchange is in the
              intermediate-to-fast regime. The image contrasts scale differently
              with field strength, exchange rate and concentration. CONCLUSION:
              CEST and R1ρ measurements provide different and somewhat
              complementary information about exchange in tissues. Whereas CEST
              can depict exchange of protons with specific chemical shifts,
              appropriate R1ρ-dependent acquisitions can be employed to

              measurement has not been studied through Bloch simulations. In
              this work, modified Look-Locker imaging was characterized through
              a numerical solution for Bloch equations. MRI sequence parameters
              that may affect T(1) accuracy were systematically varied in the
              simulation. For validation, phantoms were constructed with various
              T(2) and T(1) times and compared with Bloch equation simulations.
              Human volunteers were also evaluated with various pulse sequences
              parameters to assess the validity of the numerical simulations.
              There was close agreement between simulated T(1) times and T(1)
              times measured in phantoms and volunteers. Lower T(2) times (i.e.,
              <30 ms) resulted in errors greater than 5\% for T(1)
              determination. Increasing maximum inversion time value improved
              T(1) accuracy particularly for precontrast myocardial T(1).
              Balanced steady-state free precession k space centric encoding
              improved accuracy for short T(1) times (post gadolinium), but
              linear encoding provided improved accuracy for precontrast T(1)
              values. Lower flip angles are preferred if the signal-to-noise
              ratio is sufficiently high. Bloch simulations for modified
              Look-Locker imaging provide an accurate method to comprehensively
              quantify the effect of pulse sequence parameters on T(1) accuracy.
              As an alternative to otherwise lengthy phantom studies or human
              studies, such simulations may be useful to optimize the modified

              imaging methods in quantifying molecular changes and early
              diagnostic aspects of cartilage degeneration are described. The

              sodium NMR of biological tissues and is followed by a section on
              multiple quantum filters that can be used to quantify both
              bi-exponential relaxation and residual quadrupolar interaction.
              Specifically, (i) the rationale behind the use of sodium MRI in
              quantifying proteoglycan (PG) changes, (ii) validation studies
              using biochemical assays, (iii) studies on human OA specimens,

              RF pulses with no interpulse intervals, placed prior to an

              measured for human occipital lobe 1H2O at 4T using brief imaging
              readouts following such pulse trains. Two members of the
              hyperbolic secant (HSn) AFP pulse family (n=1 or 4; i.e., arising
              from different amplitude- and frequency-modulation functions) were
              used. These produced two different non-monoexponential signal
              decays during the pulse trains. Thus, there are differing
              contrasts in asymptotic T1rho' maps derived from these data. This
              behavior is quite different than that of 1H2O signals from an
              aqueous protein solution of roughly the same macromolecular volume
              fraction as tissue. The ROI-averaged decays from the two
              acquisitions can be simultaneously accommodated by a
              two-site-exchange model for an equilibrium isochronous process
              whose exchange condition is modulated during the pulse. The model
              employs a two-spin description of dipolar interaction fluctuations
              in each site. The intrinsic site R1rho(identical with T1rho(-1))
              value is sensitive to fluctuations at the effective Larmor
              frequency (omegaeff) in the rotating frame, and this is modulated
              differently during the two types of AFP pulses. Agreement with the

              characteristic of macromolecule-interacting water (site A) and
              bulk-like water (site B). Since R1rhoA is significantly modulated
              while R1rhoB is not, the intrinsic relaxographic shutter-speed for
              the process (identical with /R1rhoA-R1rhoB/), and thus the
              exchange condition, is modulated. However, the mean residence time
              (67 ms) and intrinsic population fraction (0.2) values found for
              site A are each rather larger than might be expected, suggesting a
              disproportionate role for the water molecules known to be

              whether cortical lesions are better visualized using magnetization
              prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) than
              T2*-weighted imaging on 7T MR imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
              Brain MR imaging using T1-weighted MP2RAGE at 500-μm isotropic
              resolution, T2*-weighted gradient-echo, and T2*-weighted segmented
              echo-planar imaging sequences were collected for 13 patients with
              MS and 5 age-matched neurologically healthy controls on a 7T
              research system. One MS case underwent postmortem MR imaging
              including gradient-echo and MP2RAGE sequences, after which
              cortical lesions seen on MR imaging were assessed with
              immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: MP2RAGE detected 203 cortical
              lesions (median, 16 lesions/case; interquartile range, 15),
              compared to 92 with T2*gradient-echo (median, 7; interquartile
              range, 8; P < .001) and 81 with T2*EPI (median, 7; interquartile
              range, 5; P < .001). This increase in lesion number detected on
              MP2RAGE versus T2* was observed for juxtacortical, leukocortical,
              and intracortical lesions. Forty-three percent of all cortical
              lesions were identified only on MP2RAGE. White matter lesion
              volume correlated with total juxtacortical (r = 0.86, P < .001)
              and leukocortical lesion volume (r = 0.70, P < .01) but not
              intracortical lesion volume, suggesting that pathophysiology may
              differ by lesion type. Of 4 suspected lesions seen on postmortem
              imaging, 3 were found to be true cortical lesions while 1
              represented postmortem tissue damage. CONCLUSIONS: A combination
              of MP2RAGE and T2*-weighted imaging at 7T improved detection of
              cortical lesions and should enable longitudinal studies to
              elucidate their spatiotemporal dynamics and clinical implications.",

              sequences can produce B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps comparable in quality
              and acquisition time to advanced techniques. MATERIALS AND

              multislice spin-echo echo planar imaging double-angle (EPI-DA) B1
              mapping protocol, using a standard product pulse sequence, was
              compared to two alternative methods (actual flip angle imaging,
              AFI, and Bloch-Siegert shift, BS). Single-slice spin-echo DA B1
              maps were used as a reference for comparison (Ref. DA). VFA flip
              angles were scaled using each B1 map prior to fitting T1 ; the
              nominal flip angle case was also compared. RESULTS: The
              pooled-subject voxelwise correlation (ρ) for B1 maps

              functional MRI are beginning to enable analysis of intracortical
              structures such as heavily myelinated layers in 3D, a prerequisite
              for in-vivo parcellation of individual human brains. This
              parcellation can only be performed precisely if the profiles used
              in cortical analysis are anatomically meaningful. Profiles are
              often constructed as traverses that are perpendicular to computed
              laminae. In this case they are fully determined by these laminae.
              The aim of this study is to evaluate models for cortical laminae
              used so far and to establish a new model. Methods to model the
              laminae used so far include constructing laminae that keep a
              constant distance to the cortical boundaries, so-called
              equidistant laminae. Another way is to compute equipotentials
              between the cortical boundary surfaces with the Laplace equation.
              The Laplace profiles resulting from the gradients to the
              equipotentials were often-used because of their nice mathematical
              properties. However, the equipotentials these Laplacian profiles
              are constructed from and the equidistant laminae do not follow the
              anatomical layers observed using high resolution MRI of cadaver
              brain. To remedy this problem, we introduce a novel equi-volume
              model that derives from work by Bok (1929). He argued that
              cortical segments preserve their volume, while layer thickness
              changes to compensate cortical folding. We incorporate this
              preservation of volume in our new equi-volume model to generate a
              three-dimensional well-adapted undistorted coordinate system of
              the cortex. When defined by this well-adapted coordinate system,
              cortical depth is anatomically meaningful. We compare isocontours
              from these cortical depth values to locations of myelinated bands
              on high-resolution ex-vivo and in-vivo three-dimensional MR
              images. A similar comparison was performed with equipotentials
              computed with the Laplace equation and with equidistant
              isocontours. A quantitative evaluation of the equi-volume model
              using measured image intensities confirms that it provides a much
              better fit to observed cortical layering.",

              changes in subchondral and trabecular bone, including sclerosis

              the cartilage lesions. However, standard cartilage dedicated
              magnetic resonance (MR) techniques are inconclusive in quantifying
              early degenerative changes. The objective of this study was to
              determine the ability of MR T1rho (T(1rho)) and T(2) mapping to
              detect cartilage matrix degeneration between normal and early OA
              patients. METHOD: Sixteen healthy volunteers (mean age 41.3)
              without clinical or radiological evidence of OA and 10 patients
              (mean age 55.9) with OA were scanned using a 3Tesla (3T) MR
              scanner. Cartilage volume and thickness, and T(1rho) and T(2)
              values were compared between normal and OA patients. The
              relationship between T(1rho) and T(2) values, and
              Kellgren-Lawrence scores based on plain radiographs and the
              cartilage lesion grading based on MR images were studied. RESULTS:
              The average T(1rho) and T(2) values were significantly increased
              in OA patients compared with controls (52.04+/-2.97ms vs
              45.53+/-3.28ms with P=0.0002 for T(1rho), and 39.63+/-2.69ms vs
              34.74+/-2.48ms with P=0.001 for T(2)). Increased T(1rho) and T(2)
              values were correlated with increased severity in radiographic and
              MR grading of OA. T(1rho) has a larger range and higher effect
              size than T(2), 3.7 vs 3.0. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
              both in vivo T(1rho) and T(2) relaxation times increase with the
              degree of cartilage degeneration. T(1rho) relaxation time may be a
              more sensitive indicator for early cartilage degeneration than
              T(2). The ability to detect early cartilage degeneration prior to
              morphologic changes may allow us to critically monitor the course
              of OA and injury progression, and to evaluate the success of
              treatment to patients with early stages of OA.",

              The reduced SAR method employs a partial k-space acquisition
              approach in which a full power spin-lock pulse is applied to only
              the central phase-encode lines of k-space, while the remainder of
              k-space receives a low-power spin-lock pulse. Acquisition of high-
              and low-power phase-encode lines are interspersed chronologically
              to minimize average power deposition. In this way, the majority of
              signal energy in the central portion of k-space receives full
              T(1rho)-weighting, while the average SAR of the overall

              validated in phantoms and reporting excellent agreement with
              literature. However, values in literature vary greatly, with T1 in
              white matter ranging from 690 to 1100 ms at 3 Tesla. This brings
              into question the accuracy of one of the most fundamental
              measurements in quantitative MRI. Our goal was to explain these
              variations and look into ways of mitigating them. Theory and
              Methods We evaluated the three most common T1 mapping methods
              (inversion recovery, Look-Locker, and variable flip angle) through
              Bloch simulations, a white matter phantom and the brains of 10
              healthy subjects (single-slice). We pooled the T1 histograms of
              the subjects to determine whether there is a sequence-dependent
              bias and whether it is reproducible across subjects. Results We
              found good agreement between the three methods in phantoms, but
              poor agreement in vivo, with the white matter T1 histogram peak in
              healthy subjects varying by more than 30\% depending on the method
              used. We also found that the pooled brain histograms displayed
              three distinct white matter peaks, with Look-Locker consistently
              underestimating, and variable flip angle overestimating the
              inversion recovery T1 values. The Bloch simulations indicated that
              incomplete spoiling and inaccurate B1 mapping could account for
              the observed differences. Conclusion We conclude that the three
              most common T1 mapping protocols produce stable T1 values in
              phantoms, but not in vivo. To improve the accuracy of T1 mapping,
              we recommend that sites perform in vivo validation of their T1
              mapping method against the inversion recovery reference method, as
              the first step toward developing a robust calibration scheme. Magn

              entire brain between gray matter and surrounding white matter
              tissue and cerebrospinal fluid by rapidly acquiring data at two
              points during an inversion recovery, and then combining the two
              volumes so as to cancel out sources of intensity and contrast
              bias, making it useful for neuroimaging studies at ultrahigh field
              strengths (≥7T). To quantify the effectiveness of the MP2RAGE
              method for quantitative morphometric neuroimaging, we performed
              tissue segmentation and cerebral cortical surface reconstruction
              of the MP2RAGE data and compared the results with those generated
              from conventional multi-echo MPRAGE (MEMPRAGE) data across a group
              of healthy subjects. To do so, we developed a preprocessing scheme
              for the MP2RAGE image data to allow for automatic cortical
              segmentation and surface reconstruction using FreeSurfer and
              analysis methods to compare the positioning of the surface meshes.
              Using image volumes with 1mm isotropic voxels we found a
              scan-rescan reproducibility of cortical thickness estimates to be
              0.15 mm (or 6\%) for the MEMPRAGE data and a slightly lower
              reproducibility of 0.19 mm (or 8\%) for the MP2RAGE data. We also
              found that the thickness estimates were systematically smaller in
              the MP2RAGE data, and that both the interior and exterior cortical
              boundaries estimated from the MP2RAGE data were consistently
              positioned within the corresponding boundaries estimated from the
              MEMPRAGE data. Therefore several measureable differences exist in
              the appearance of cortical gray matter and its effect on automatic
              segmentation methods that must be considered when choosing an
              acquisition or segmentation method for studies requiring cortical
              surface reconstructions. We propose potential extensions to the
              MP2RAGE method that may help to reduce or eliminate these
              discrepancies.",

              criticized due to the presence of various error sources.
              Specifically, anatomical MRI relying on T1 contrast may be
              unreliable due to spatially variable image contrast between gray
              matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
              Especially at ultra-high field (≥ 7T) MRI, transmit and receive B1
              -related image inhomogeneities can hamper correct classification
              of tissue types. In the current paper, we demonstrate that
              residual B1+ (transmit) inhomogeneities in the T1 -weighted and
              quantitative T1 images using the MP2RAGE sequence at 7T lead to
              biases in cortical thickness measurements. As expected, post-hoc
              correction for the spatially varying B1+ profile reduced the
              apparent T1 values across the cortex in regions with low B1+, and
              slightly increased apparent T1 in regions with high B1+. As a
              result, improved contrast-to-noise ratio both at the GM-CSF and
              GM-WM boundaries can be observed leading to more accurate surface
              reconstructions and cortical thickness estimates. Overall, the
              changes in cortical thickness ranged between a 5\% decrease to a
              70\% increase after B1+ correction, reducing the variance of
              cortical thickness values across the brain dramatically and
              increasing the comparability with normative data. More
              specifically, the cortical thickness estimates increased in
              regions characterized by a strong decrease of apparent T1 after
              B1+ correction in regions with low B1+ due to improved detection
              of the pial surface. The current results suggest that cortical
              thickness can be more accurately determined using MP2RAGE data at
              7T if B1+ inhomogeneities are accounted for.",

              inaccuracies in the generation of the prescribed FAs by estimating
              the actual FAs, and (c) incorporates data-driven local B1
              inhomogeneity corrections. The method was validated and its
              accuracy tested using simulated data, phantom, and in vivo
              experiments. Results were compared with existing analysis methods
              and to inversion recovery (IR). Consistency was assessed by means
              of repeated scans of two subjects. Reference values were obtained
              from eight healthy subjects from various brain regions and
              compared with literature values. RESULTS: The method accurately
              and consistently estimated T1 values in all cases. The method was
              more robust, in comparison with the standard method, to the choice
              of FA set; to inaccuracies in generation of the prescribed FAs (in
              simulated data, T1 estimation error was 12.1 ms versus 235.5 ms);
              demonstrated greater consistency (in vivo study showed interscan
              T1 difference of 80 ms versus 356 ms); and achieved a better
              agreement with IR on phantom (median absolute difference of 123.8
              ms versus 790 ms). Reference T1 values were 883/801 ms for
              female/male in white matter and 1501/1349 ms in gray matter,
              within the range previously reported. CONCLUSION: The proposed
              method overcomes some inaccuracies in FA production, providing
              more accurate estimation of T1 values compared with standard
              methods, and is applicable for currently available data.",

              rate of solvent water protons, 1/T1, increases markedly in
              homogeneous protein solutions as the magnetic field is reduced
              well below the traditional NMR range. For a 5\% solution of
              protein of 10(5) Da, for example, 1/T1 increases from about 50\%
              above the pure water rate of 20 MHz to five times the water rate
              at 0.01 MHz. For tissue, including blood, the behavior is similar.
              Data for blood show that extracellular water has ready access to
              the hemoglobin inside red blood cells, which causes the enhanced
              relaxation. The extent to which cell water can sample the spatial
              structure of soft tissue, and how this structure influences
              relaxation rates, is as yet unknown. Nonetheless, the relaxation
              data for tissue can be accommodated within the conceptual
              framework developed earlier for analyzing homogeneous solutions of
              diamagnetic proteins. The variation of 1/T1 with field differs
              among tissues, and its magnitude at a given field can vary by more
              than a factor of three, far more than does the water content of
              the tissues. Solute complexes of paramagnetic ions with
              macromolecules, which increase the relaxation rates of solvent
              protons, can be introduced intravenously in tissue. They are known
              to accumulate in specific organs, and therefore have potential
              utility as contrast-enhancing agents in NMR imaging. Mn2+ and
              Gd3+, for example, produce characteristic dependences of 1/T1 on
              magnetic field that vary with the chemical state of the agent. The

              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the measured signal is essential
              in order to estimate reliably the parameters from a small number
              of samples, thus prompting the use of a sequence with high SNR,
              such as a three-dimensional spoiled gradient acquisition. Here, we

              contrast agent with standard T1-weighted (T1w) and with sequences
              to quantify T1 before radiation, and at 6-week intervals during
              radio-chemotherapy. We measured contrast enhancement by
              subtracting pre from post contrast contrast images, yielding
              relative signal increase ∆T1w and relative T1 shortening ∆qT1. On
              ∆qT1, we identified a solid and a cloudy-enhancing compartment and

              PFS. In ∆qT1 maps cloudy-enhancing compartments were found in all

              The qT1 decrease in the cloudy-enhancing compartment post contrast
              was 21.64\% versus 1.96\% in the contralateral control tissue (P <

              B(1) mapping are widely used quantitative MRI methods employing
              radiofrequency spoiled gradient-echo pulse sequences. Incomplete
              elimination of the transverse magnetization in these sequences has
              been found to be a critical source of T(1) and B(1) measurement
              errors. In this study, comprehensive theoretical analysis of
              spoiling-related errors in variable flip angle and actual
              flip-angle imaging methods was performed using the combined
              isochromat summation and diffusion propagator model and validated
              by phantom experiments. The key theoretical conclusion is that
              correct interpretation of spoiling phenomena in fast gradient-echo
              sequences requires accurate consideration of the diffusion effect.
              A general strategy for improvement of T(1) and B(1) measurement
              accuracy was proposed based on the strong spoiling regimen, where
              diffusion-modulated spatial averaging of isochromats becomes a
              dominant factor determining magnetization evolution. Practical
              implementation of strongly spoiled variable flip angle and actual

              diseases. T1rho magnetic resonance imaging is a potentially
              important technique for noninvasive diagnosis, severity grading,
              and therapy monitoring of liver fibrosis. However, it remains
              challenging to perform robust T1rho quantification of liver on
              human subjects. One major reason is that the presence of rich
              blood signal in liver can cause artificially high T1rho
              measurement and makes T1rho quantification susceptible to motion.
              METHODS: A pulse sequence based on single shot fast/turbo spin
              echo (SSFSE/SSTSE) acquisition, with theoretical analysis and
              simulation based on the extended phase graph (EPG) algorithm, was
              presented for breath-hold single slice quantitative T1rho imaging
              of liver with suppression of blood signal. The pulse sequence was
              evaluated in human subjects at 3.0 T with 500 Hz spinlock
              frequency and time-of-spinlock (TSL) 0, 10, 30 and 50 ms. RESULTS:
              Human scan demonstrated that the entire T1rho data sets with four
              spinlock time can be acquired within a single breath-hold of 10
              seconds with black blood effect. T1rho quantification with
              suppression of blood signal results in significantly reduced T1rho
              value of liver compared to the results without blood suppression.
              CONCLUSIONS: A signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficient pulse
              sequence was reported for T1rho quantification of liver. The black
              blood effect, together with a short breath-hold, mitigates the
              risk of quantification errors as would occur in the conventional

              evaluate the accuracy of precontrast T1 estimation with and
              without B1+ variation in breast MRI patients at 3 Tesla (T).
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: B1+ and variable flip angle (VFA) T1
              mapping were included in our dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)
              breast imaging protocol to study a total of 25 patients on a 3.0T
              GE MR 750 system. We computed precontrast T1 relaxation in fat,
              which we assumed to be consistent across a cohort of breast
              imaging subjects, with and without compensation for B1+ variation.
              The mean and standard deviation of B1+ and T1 values were
              calculated for statistical data analysis. RESULTS: Our
              measurements showed a consistent B1+ field difference between the
              left and right breasts. The left breast has an average 15.4\%
              higher flip angle than the prescribed flip angle, and the right
              breast has an average 17.6\% lower flip angle than the prescribed
              flip angle. This average 33\% flip angle difference, which can be
              vendor and model specific, creates a 52\% T1 estimation bias in
              fat between breasts using the VFA T1 mapping technique. The T1
              variation is reduced to 7\% by including B1+ correction.
              CONCLUSION: We have shown that severe B1+ variation over the
              breasts can cause a substantial error in T1 estimation between the
              breasts, in VFA T1 maps at 3T, but that compensating for these
              variations can considerably improve accuracy of T1 measurements,
              which can directly benefit quantitative breast DCE-MRI at 3T.",

              relating signal intensity to flip angle and TR is nonlinear;
              however, a linear form proposed 30 years ago is currently widely

              the fitting. This bias can be significant for clinical SPGR
              images; for example, T(1) estimated in brain tissue (800 ms < T(1)
              < 1600 ms) can be overestimated by 10\% to 20\%. We propose a
              weighting scheme that correctly accounts for the noise
              contribution in the fitting procedure. Monte Carlo simulations of

              biexponential relaxation, but most quantitative T1 measurements
              fit data assuming monoexponential relaxation. The resulting
              monoexponential T1 estimate varies based on scan parameters and
              represents a source of variation between studies, especially at
              high fields. In this study, we characterized WM T1 relaxation and
              performed simulations to determine how to minimize this deviation.
              METHODS: To characterize biexponential relaxation, four volunteers
              were scanned at 3T and 7T using inversion recovery fast spin echo
              (IR-FSE) with 13 inversion times (TIs). Three volunteers were
              scanned with IR-FSE using TIs chosen by simulations to reduce T1
              deviation, and with MP2RAGE. RESULTS: At 3T, the biexponential
              relaxation has a short component of T1 = 48 ms (9\%) and a long
              component of T1 = 939 ms. At 7T the short component is T1 = 57 ms
              (11\%) and the long component is 1349 ms (89\%). For IR-FSE,
              acquiring four TIs with a minimum of 150 ms (3T) or 200 ms (7T)
              yielded monoexponential T1 estimates that match the long component
              to within 10 ms. For MP2RAGE, significant differences (90 ms at
              3T, 125 ms at 7T) remain at all parameter values. CONCLUSION: Many
              T1 mapping sequences yield robust estimates of the long T1
              component with suitable choice of TIs, allowing reproducible,
              sequence-independent T1 values to be measured. However, this is

              radiofrequency-spoiled gradient-echo data sets, acquired with
              different flip angles α. Because the method assumes validity of
              the Ernst equation, insufficient spoiling of transverse
              magnetization yields errors in T1 estimation, depending on the
              chosen radiofrequency-spoiling phase increment (Δϕ). This paper
              presents a versatile correction method that uses modified flip
              angles α' to restore the validity of the Ernst equation. METHODS:
              Spoiled gradient-echo signals were simulated for three commonly
              used phase increments Δϕ (50°/117°/150°), different values of α,
              repetition time (TR), T1 , and a T2 of 85 ms. For each parameter
              combination, α' (for which the Ernst equation yielded the same
              signal) and a correction factor CΔϕ (α, TR, T1 ) = α'/α were
              determined. CΔϕ was found to be independent of T1 and fitted as
              polynomial CΔϕ (α, TR), allowing to calculate α' for any protocol
              using this Δϕ. The accuracy of the correction method for T2 values
              deviating from 85 ms was also determined. The method was tested in
              vitro and in vivo for variable flip angle scans with different
              acquisition parameters. RESULTS: The technique considerably
              improved the accuracy of variable flip angle-based T1 maps in
              vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method allows for a
              simple correction of insufficient spoiling in gradient-echo data.
