  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), a
              magnetic resonance imaging technique used to assess tissue
              integrity, correlates with demyelination and axonal loss in
              multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. In acute white matter lesions,
              short-term MTR changes mainly reflect demyelination and
              remyelination, in addition to edema and axonal and glial changes.
              Long-term MTR changes in MS lesions have not been studied
              extensively. METHODS: A new quantitative image analysis method was
              developed to measure long-term MTR changes in MS lesions. The
              method was applied to a group of 59 patients and 14 healthy
              control subjects followed for 4 years. MTR changes in white matter
              lesions were analyzed, where lesion voxels were classified into
              six categories based on starting MTR and change over time. For
              each patient, the proportion of lesion voxels in each MTR-change
              category was calculated. Correlations between long-term MTR
              evolution, disability progression, and brain atrophy were
              investigated. RESULTS: The proportion of lesion voxels in the high
              stable category correlated with less atrophy progression, while
              the proportion with low and increasing MTR correlated with
              increased atrophy. The proportion of lesion voxels in the high and
              stable MTR lesion category was significantly different between MS
              disease subgroups. The group with disability progression had a
              higher proportion of lesion voxels with low and increasing MTR.
              CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that long-term changes in MTR
              in white matter lesions can be used to distinguish lesion subtypes
              associated with MS disease progression and improve understanding
              of the temporal evolution of MS pathology.",

               are developed. There is hence a need for open-source
               implementations of common quantitative methods. • QUIT
               (http://github.com/spinicist/QUIT) provides implementations of

               based processing pipelines, and are easy to use with a queue
               system such as the Sun Grid Engine. They are hence suitable for
               the high-throughput processing that is required for timely

               R2⋆, proton density PD and magnetisation transfer MT saturation)

               (MT) can lead to a considerable loss of steady-state signal.
               Thus, especially in tissues, the analytical description of bSSFP
               requires a revision to fully take observed effects into account.
               In the first part of this work, an extended bSSFP signal equation

               in MDD patients with a history of suicide attempts relative to
               MDD patients without such history. The participants were 36

               a history of a suicide attempt, and 28 healthy controls matched
               for age and gender. Whole brain voxel-based analysis was used to
               compare MTR across three groups and to analyze correlations with
               symptom severity and illness duration. We identified decreased
               MTR in left inferior parietal lobule and right superior parietal
               lobule in suicide attempters relative to both non-attempters and
               controls. Non-attempters also showed significantly reduced MTR in

               MTR reduction in left cerebellum. These abnormalities were not

               abnormalities in parietal cortex compared to nonsuicidal
               depressed patients and healthy controls. Parietal lobe
               abnormalities might cause attentional dysfunction and impaired
               decision making to increase risk for suicidal behavior in MDD.",

               considerable signal loss in tissues. This apparent signal
               reduction originates from magnetization transfer (MT) and may be
               reduced by an increase in repetition time or by a reduction in
               flip angle. In this work, MT effects in bSSFP are modulated by a
               modification of the bSSFP sequence scheme. Strong signal
               attenuations are achieved with short radio frequency (RF) pulses
               in combination with short repetition times, whereas near full,
               i.e., MT-free, bSSFP signal is obtained by a considerable
               prolongation of the RF pulse duration. Similar to standard
               methods, the MT ratio (MTR) in bSSFP depends on several sequence
               parameters. Optimized bSSFP protocol settings are derived that
               can be applied to various tissues yielding maximal sensitivity to
               MT while minimizing contribution from other impurities, such as
               off-resonances. Evaluation of MT in human brain using such
               optimized bSSFP protocols shows high correlation with MTR values
               from commonly used gradient echo (GRE) sequences. In summary, a
               novel method to generate MTR maps using bSSFP image acquisitions
               is presented and factors that optimize and influence this
               contrast are discussed.",

  abstract  = "Purpose There are many T1 mapping methods available, each of them
               validated in phantoms and reporting excellent agreement with
               literature. However, values in literature vary greatly, with T1
               in white matter ranging from 690 to 1100 ms at 3 Tesla. This
               brings into question the accuracy of one of the most fundamental
               measurements in quantitative MRI. Our goal was to explain these
               variations and look into ways of mitigating them. Theory and
               Methods We evaluated the three most common T1 mapping methods
               (inversion recovery, Look-Locker, and variable flip angle)
               through Bloch simulations, a white matter phantom and the brains
               of 10 healthy subjects (single-slice). We pooled the T1
               histograms of the subjects to determine whether there is a
               sequence-dependent bias and whether it is reproducible across
               subjects. Results We found good agreement between the three
               methods in phantoms, but poor agreement in vivo, with the white
               matter T1 histogram peak in healthy subjects varying by more than
               30\% depending on the method used. We also found that the pooled
               brain histograms displayed three distinct white matter peaks,
               with Look-Locker consistently underestimating, and variable flip
               angle overestimating the inversion recovery T1 values. The Bloch
               simulations indicated that incomplete spoiling and inaccurate B1
               mapping could account for the observed differences. Conclusion We
               conclude that the three most common T1 mapping protocols produce
               stable T1 values in phantoms, but not in vivo. To improve the
               accuracy of T1 mapping, we recommend that sites perform in vivo
               validation of their T1 mapping method against the inversion
               recovery reference method, as the first step toward developing a
               robust calibration scheme. Magn Reson Med 73:514?522, 2015. ?
