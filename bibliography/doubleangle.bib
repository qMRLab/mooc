  abstract = "A novel approach to correcting for intensity nonuniformity in
              magnetic resonance (MR) data is described that achieves high
              performance without requiring a model of the tissue classes
              present. The method has the advantage that it can be applied at an
              early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue model
              is available. Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity
              normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence
              and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate
              model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field
              estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate
              both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the
              true tissue intensities. The performance of this method is
              evaluated using both real and simulated MR data.",

               easily reproduced bench experiment that validates the principle
               is therefore described. Building on the experimental results,
               elementary mathematics are employed to derive simple equations
               for the B1 fields in both the negatively and the positively
               rotating frames. Using these equations, the reader is then guided
               through the steps needed to deduce correctly the signal received
               in an NMR experiment. The article should serve as a resource for
               those attempting signal strength calculations. © 2000 John Wiley

              shown, for a solenoidal receiving coil, to give the same results
              as the traditional method of calculation, but its advantage lies
              in its ability to predict the ratio for other coil configurations.
              Particular attention is paid to the poor performance of a
              saddle-shaped (or Helmholtz) coil. Some of the practical problems
              involved are also discussed, including the error of matching the
              probe to the input impedance of the preamplifier.",
