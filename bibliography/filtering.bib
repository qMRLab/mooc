  abstract = "Following early efforts in applying nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy to study biological processes in intact
              systems, and particularly since the introduction of 4 T human
              scanners circa 1990, rapid progress was made in imaging and
              spectroscopy studies of humans at 4 T and animal models at 9.4 T,
              leading to the introduction of 7 T and higher magnetic fields for
              human investigation at about the turn of the century. Work
              conducted on these platforms has provided numerous technological
              solutions to challenges posed at these ultrahigh fields, and
              demonstrated the existence of significant advantages in
              signal-to-noise ratio and biological information content. Primary
              difference from lower fields is the deviation from the near field
              regime at the radiofrequencies (RF) corresponding to hydrogen
              resonance conditions. At such ultrahigh fields, the RF is
              characterized by attenuated traveling waves in the human body,
              which leads to image non-uniformities for a given sample-coil
              configuration because of destructive and constructive
              interferences. These non-uniformities were initially considered
              detrimental to progress of imaging at high field strengths.
              However, they are advantageous for parallel imaging in signal
              reception and transmission, two critical technologies that
              account, to a large extend, for the success of ultrahigh fields.
              With these technologies and improvements in instrumentation and
              imaging methods, today ultrahigh fields have provided
              unprecedented gains in imaging of brain function and anatomy, and
              started to make inroads into investigation of the human torso and
              extremities. As extensive as they are, these gains still
              constitute a prelude to what is to come given the increasingly
              larger effort committed to ultrahigh field research and
              development of ever better instrumentation and techniques.",

               B(1) (+) mapping at 3T in the human brain: three-dimensional (3D)
               actual flip angle imaging (AFI), 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI),
               and two-dimensional (2D) stimulated echo acquisition mode
               (STEAM). We performed a comprehensive comparison of the methods,
               focusing on artifacts, reproducibility, and accuracy compared to
               a reference 2D double angle method. For the 3D AFI method, the
               addition of flow-compensated gradients for diffusion damping
               reduced the level of physiological artifacts and improved
               spoiling of transverse coherences. Correction of
               susceptibility-induced artifacts alleviated image distortions and
               improved the accuracy of the 3D EPI imaging method. For the 2D
               STEAM method, averaging over multiple acquisitions reduced the
               impact of physiological noise and a new calibration method
               enhanced the accuracy of the B(1) (+) maps. After optimization,
               all methods yielded low noise B(1) (+) maps (below 2 percentage
               units), of the nominal flip angle value (p.u.) with a systematic
               bias less than 5 p.u. units. Full brain coverage was obtained in
               less than 5 min. The 3D AFI method required minimal
               postprocessing and showed little sensitivity to off-resonance and
               physiological effects. The 3D EPI method showed the highest level
               of reproducibility. The 2D STEAM method was the most
               time-efficient technique.",

               occurring in a pure water phantom near 300 MHz is greatly
               dampened in the human head due to the strong decay of the
               electromagnetic wave. The characteristic image intensity
               distribution in the human head is the result of spatial phase

               of the transmitted radiofrequency (RF) field. The method employs
               an actual flip-angle imaging (AFI) pulse sequence that consists
               of two identical RF pulses followed by two delays of different
               duration (TR(1) < TR(2)). After each pulse, a gradient-echo (GRE)
               signal is acquired. It has been shown theoretically and
               experimentally that if delays TR(1) and TR(2) are sufficiently
               short and the transverse magnetization is completely spoiled, the
               ratio r = S(2)/S(1) of signal intensities S(1) and S(2), acquired
               at the beginning of the time intervals TR(1) and TR(2), depends
               on the flip angle (FA) of applied pulses as r = (1 + n *
               cos(FA))/(n + cos(FA)), where n = TR(2)/TR(1). The method allows
               fast 3D implementation and provides accurate B(1) measurements
               that are highly insensitive to T(1). The unique feature of the
               AFI method is that it uses a pulsed steady-state signal
               acquisition. This overcomes the limitation of previous methods
               that required long relaxation delays between sequence
               repetitions. The method has been shown to be useful for
               time-efficient whole-body B(1) mapping and correction of T(1)
               maps obtained using a variable FA technique in the presence of
               nonuniform RF excitation.",
