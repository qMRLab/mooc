  abstract = "PURPOSE: B1 mapping is important for many quantitative imaging
              protocols, particularly those that include whole-brain T1 mapping
              using the variable flip angle (VFA) technique. However, B1 mapping
              sequences are not typically available on many magnetic resonance
              imaging (MRI) scanners. The aim of this work was to demonstrate
              that B1 mapping implemented using standard scanner product pulse
              sequences can produce B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps comparable in quality
              and acquisition time to advanced techniques. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Six healthy subjects were scanned at 3.0T. An interleaved
              multislice spin-echo echo planar imaging double-angle (EPI-DA) B1
              mapping protocol, using a standard product pulse sequence, was
              compared to two alternative methods (actual flip angle imaging,
              AFI, and Bloch-Siegert shift, BS). Single-slice spin-echo DA B1
              maps were used as a reference for comparison (Ref. DA). VFA flip
              angles were scaled using each B1 map prior to fitting T1 ; the
              nominal flip angle case was also compared. RESULTS: The
              pooled-subject voxelwise correlation (ρ) for B1 maps
              (BS/AFI/EPI-DA) relative to the reference B1 scan (Ref. DA) were ρ
              = 0.92/0.95/0.98. VFA T1 correlations using these maps were ρ =
              0.86/0.88/0.96, much better than without B1 correction (ρ = 0.53).
              The relative error for each B1 map (BS/AFI/EPI-DA/Nominal) had
              95th percentiles of 5/4/3/13\%. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that
              B1 mapping implemented using product pulse sequences can provide
              excellent quality B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps, comparable to other
              custom techniques. This fast whole-brain measurement (∼2 min) can
              serve as an excellent alternative for researchers without access
              to advanced B1 pulse sequences. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical

              radio-frequency (RF) coils is often present in neurological scans
              using circularly polarized coils, a theoretical analysis has been
              conducted of the intensity nonuniformity inherent in imaging an
              elliptically shaped object using 1.5-T magnets and circularly
              polarized RF coils. This first principle analysis clarifies, for
              the general case of conducting objects, the relationship between
              the excitation field and the reception sensitivity of circularly
              and linearly polarized coils. The results, validated
              experimentally using a standard spin-echo imaging sequence and an
              in vivo B1 field mapping technique, are shown to be accurate to
              within 1\%-2\% root mean square, suggesting that these

  abstract = "Following early efforts in applying nuclear magnetic resonance
              (NMR) spectroscopy to study biological processes in intact
              systems, and particularly since the introduction of 4 T human
              scanners circa 1990, rapid progress was made in imaging and
              spectroscopy studies of humans at 4 T and animal models at 9.4 T,
              leading to the introduction of 7 T and higher magnetic fields for
              human investigation at about the turn of the century. Work
              conducted on these platforms has provided numerous technological
              solutions to challenges posed at these ultrahigh fields, and
              demonstrated the existence of significant advantages in
              signal-to-noise ratio and biological information content. Primary
              difference from lower fields is the deviation from the near field
              regime at the radiofrequencies (RF) corresponding to hydrogen
              resonance conditions. At such ultrahigh fields, the RF is
              characterized by attenuated traveling waves in the human body,
              which leads to image non-uniformities for a given sample-coil
              configuration because of destructive and constructive
              interferences. These non-uniformities were initially considered
              detrimental to progress of imaging at high field strengths.
              However, they are advantageous for parallel imaging in signal
              reception and transmission, two critical technologies that
              account, to a large extend, for the success of ultrahigh fields.
              With these technologies and improvements in instrumentation and
              imaging methods, today ultrahigh fields have provided
              unprecedented gains in imaging of brain function and anatomy, and
              started to make inroads into investigation of the human torso and
              extremities. As extensive as they are, these gains still
              constitute a prelude to what is to come given the increasingly
              larger effort committed to ultrahigh field research and
              development of ever better instrumentation and techniques.",

               actual flip angle imaging (AFI), 3D echo-planar imaging (EPI),

               focusing on artifacts, reproducibility, and accuracy compared to
               a reference 2D double angle method. For the 3D AFI method, the
               addition of flow-compensated gradients for diffusion damping
               reduced the level of physiological artifacts and improved
               spoiling of transverse coherences. Correction of

               bias less than 5 p.u. units. Full brain coverage was obtained in
               less than 5 min. The 3D AFI method required minimal
               postprocessing and showed little sensitivity to off-resonance and
               physiological effects. The 3D EPI method showed the highest level
