The method, which is based on selective rf irradiation of the sample in switched magnetic field gradients, can produce visual pictures considerably faster than previously described line-scan imaging methods. Some simple examples of two-dimensional images obtained by the method are presented.},

The nuclear charge number (atomic number) therefore appears in all the equations for spectral energy terms of atoms. In addition, there are other influences of the nucleus on the electronic spectra, the measurement of which generally requires an especially high spectral resolution. Therefore, one refers to a hyperfine structure of the spectral lines. By contrast, the effects of the interactions of the electrons among themselves as well as those of electronic spins with the orbital moments, which we have treated in the preceding chapters, are referred to as fine structure.},
