  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Exponential fitting of multiecho spin echo sequences
               with skipped echoes is still commonly used for quantification of
               transverse relaxation (T2 ). PURPOSE: To examine the efficacy of
               skipped echo methods for T2 quantification against computational
               modeling of the exact signal decay. STUDY TYPE: Prospective
               comparison of methods. SUBJECTS/PHANTOM: Eight volunteers were
               imaged at 4.7T, six volunteers at 1.5T, and phantoms ([MnCl2 ] =
               68-270 mM). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 1.5T and 4.7T; multiple-echo
               spin echo. ASSESSMENT: Exponential fitting for T2 using all
               echoes, skipping the first echo or skipping all odd echoes,
               compared with Bloch simulations. Resulting T2 values were
               examined over a range of T2 (10-150 msec), refocusing flip angles
               (90-270°), and echo train lengths (ETL = 6-32). STATISTICAL
               TESTS: Shapiro-Wilk tests and Q-Q plots were used to check for
               normality of data. Paired sample t-tests and Wilcoxon rank tests
               were used to compare fitting models using α = 0.05. Multiple
               comparisons were accounted for with Bonferroni correction.
               RESULTS: In examined regions of interest, typical incorrect
               estimation of T2 ranged from 23-39\% for exponential fitting of
               all echoes, or 15-32\% for skipped echo methods. In vivo, T2
               estimation error was reduced to as little as 10\% with skipped
               echo methods using 180° refocusing and ETL = 8, although error
               varied due to refocusing angle, T2 , and ETL. In vivo, skipped
               echo T2 values were significantly different than all echo
               exponential fitting (P < 0.004), but also were significantly
               different from reference values (P < 0.002, except frontal white
               matter). Simulations showed skipping the first echo was the most
               effective form of exponential fitting, in particular for T2 <50
               msec and ETL = 8, with potential to reduce T2 errors to 10\%,
               depending on refocusing angle and T2 . DATA CONCLUSION: Skipping
               echoes is insufficient for avoiding stimulated echo
               contamination. Resulting T2 errors depend on a complicated
               interplay of T2 , refocusing angle, and ETL. Modeling of the
               multiecho sequence is recommended. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2 Technical

               very simple systems that obey the extreme narrowing condition,

               shrinks and then grows back to its initial magnitude while it
               tips back toward the longitudinal axis, instead of simply

               susceptibilities (T2') is sensitive to an increased
               deoxyhemoglobin concentration in the brain, indicating tissue at
               risk for infarction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was
               approved by the local institutional review board; patients or
               their guardians provided informed consent. Magnetic resonance
               (MR) imaging was performed within 6 hours of symptom onset and
               again 1-11 days thereafter in 100 consecutive stroke patients,
               all of whom received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (mean age,
               67 years). The MR imaging protocol included diffusion- and
               perfusion-weighted imaging for determination of apparent
               diffusion coefficient (ADC) and time to peak (TTP), along with
               quantitative T2 and T2* imaging. T2' maps were calculated and
               visually compared with ADC and TTP lesions by two independent
               observers. RESULTS: A T2'>ADC mismatch was observed by reader 1
               in 73 (73\%) of 100 patients, and by reader 2 in 65 (65\%)
               patients. Respective sensitivities of T2'>ADC and of TTP>ADC
               mismatches for later infarct growth were 0.87 and 0.98 for reader
               1 and 0.78 and 0.98 for reader 2, with respective specificities
               of 0.42 and 0.04 for reader 1 and 0.46 and 0.04 for reader 2. The
               odds ratios for infarct growth in the presence of a T2'>ADC
               mismatch were 4.59 (reader 1 P = .002) and 3.10 (reader 2 P =
               .012), while the odds ratios for TTP>ADC mismatch were 2.22
               (reader 1 P = .606) and 1.73 (reader 2 P > .999). CONCLUSION: The
               presence of a T2'>ADC mismatch is a more specific predictor of
               infarct growth than is TTP>ADC mismatch and hence may be of
               clinical value in patient selection for acute stroke therapies in

               intraparenchymal pathology and 10 acute stroke patients who
               underwent MR imaging including a T2 and T2* sequence with 3
               echotimes were included. After calculation of T2*, T2', and T2
               maps, the values of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) for
               each hemisphere were measured in 6 distinct regions of interest
               (ROIs). RESULTS: There was a negative correlation between age and
               T2* values in the caudate nucleus (r = -0.34 Pearson correlation;
               P = .001) and lentiform nucleus (r = -0.67; P = .001) and a
               positive correlation in the occipital (r = 0.41; P = .001) and
               subcortical (r = 0.45; P = .001) WM. An age dependency for T2'
               values was only found for the caudate (r = -0.35; P = .001) and
               lentiform nucleus (r = -0.69; P = .001). T2' values in acute
               stroke were lower than normal in all patients with stroke.
               CONCLUSION: Decrease in T2' and T2* values in GM and increase of
               T2* values in WM correlate with the progress of brain aging.
               Explanations for decreasing T2' and T2* values include iron
               deposition in the caudate and lentiform nucleus. In contrast to
               T2* values, there is no association of T2' values with the degree
               of leukoaraiosis. These age-dependent values can be used as a
               reference in neurovascular diseases and for the discussion of
               functional MR imaging data.",

               design consists of a set of easily parameterized non-uniformly
               spaced measurement times, as opposed to present implementation of
               spin-echo experiments. Analysis of the biexponential case shows
               that an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise is required to
               achieve T2 estimates of comparable precision to monoexponential
               measurements with the same number of data points. The optimal
               designs lead to an improved ability to discriminate between two
               relatively similar relaxation times.",

               means of automatic measurement of iron content in tissues. It
               enables quick, intuitive interpretation and provides the
               potential benefit of spatial context between tissues. However,
               pixel-wise mapping uses much lower SNR data to estimate T2* when
               compared to region-based mapping thereby decreasing both its
               accuracy and precision. In this study, the effects that noise has
               on the precision and accuracy of pixel-wise T2* mapping were
               investigated and techniques to mitigate those effects are
               proposed. METHODS: To study precision across T2* mapping
               techniques, a pipeline to estimate the pixel-wise standard
               deviation (SD) of the T2* based on the fit residuals is proposed.
               For validation, a Monte-Carlo analysis was performed in which T2*
               phantoms were scanned N = 64 times, the true SD was measured and
               compared to the estimated SD. To improve accuracy and precision,
               the automatic truncation method for mitigating noise bias was
               extended to pixel-wise fitting by using an SNR scaled image
               reconstruction and truncating low SNR measurements. Finally, the
               precision and accuracy of non-linear regression with and without
               automatic truncation, were investigated using Monte-Carlo
               simulations. RESULTS: Measured and estimated SD's were >99.9\%
               correlated for non-linear regression with and without truncation.
               Non-linear regression with automatic truncation was shown to be
               the best mapping technique for improving accuracy and precision
               in low T2* and low SNR measurements. CONCLUSIONS: A method for
               applying an automatic truncation method to pixel-wise T2* mapping
               that reduces T2* overestimation due to noise bias was proposed. A

               maps for T2* that can serve as a quality map for interpreting

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: T2 relaxometry has become an important tool in
               quantitative MRI. Little focus has been put on the effect of the
               refocusing flip angle upon the offset parameter, which was
               introduced to account for a signal floor due to noise or to long
               T2 components. The aim of this study was to show that B1
               imperfections contribute significantly to the offset. We further
               introduce a simple method to reduce the systematic error in T2 by
               discarding the first echo and using the offset fitting approach.
               MATERIALS AND METHODS: Signal curves of T2 relaxometry were
               simulated based on extended phase graph theory and evaluated for
               4 different methods (inclusion and exclusion of the first echo,
               while fitting with and without the offset). We further performed
               T2 relaxometry in a phantom at 9.4T magnetic resonance imaging
               scanner and used the same methods for post-processing as in the
               extended phase graph simulated data. Single spin echo sequences
               were used to determine the correct T2 time. RESULTS: The
               simulation data showed that the systematic error in T2 and the
               offset depends on the refocusing pulse, the echo spacing and the
               echo train length. The systematic error could be reduced by
               discarding the first echo. Further reduction of the systematic T2
               error was reached by using the offset as fitting parameter. The
               phantom experiments confirmed these findings. CONCLUSION: The
               fitted offset parameter in T2 relaxometry is influenced by
               imperfect refocusing pulses. Using the offset as a fitting
               parameter and discarding the first echo is a fast and easy method
               to minimize the error in T2, particularly for low to intermediate
               echo train length.",

               significantly differ in signal, contrast, artifact behavior, and

               aid in this classification, but it is unclear which of the
               proposed techniques is best suited for this task. We, therefore,
               conducted a head-to-head study with different quantitative MR
               imaging measurements in patients with IPS, MSA-type Parkinson,
               PSP, and healthy elderly controls. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
               Thirty-one patients and 13 controls underwent a comprehensive
               quantitative MR imaging protocol including R2*-, R2- and
               R1-mapping, magnetization transfer, and DTI with manual
               region-of-interest measurements in basal ganglia regions. Group
               differences were assessed with a post hoc ANOVA with a Bonferroni
               error correction and an ROC. RESULTS: The best separation of MSA
               from IPS in patients and controls could be achieved with
               R2*-mapping in the PU, with an ROC AUC of ≤0.96, resulting in a
               sensitivity of 77.8\% (with a specificity 100\%). MD was
               increased in patients with PSP compared with controls and to a
               lesser extent compared with those with IPS and MSA in the SN.
               CONCLUSIONS: Among the applied quantitative MR imaging methods,
               R2*-mapping seems to have the best predictive power to separate
               patients with MSA from those with IPS, and DTI for identifying
               PSP.",

               mapping. The estimated values using conventional exponential fit,
               however, are hampered by stimulated and indirect echoes leading
               to overestimation of T2 . Here, we present fast analysis of
               multi-echo spin-echo (FAMESE) as a novel approach to decrease the
               complexity of the search space, which leads to accelerated
               measurement of T2 . METHODS: We developed FAMESE based on
               mathematical analysis of the Bloch equations in which the search
               space dimension decreased to only one. Then, we tested it in both
               phantom and human brain. Bland-Altman plot was used to assess the
               agreement between the estimated T2 values from FAMESE and the
               ones estimated from single-echo spin-echo sequence. The
               reliability of FAMESE was assessed by intraclass correlation
               coefficients. In addition, we investigated the noise stability of
               the method in synthetic and experimental data. RESULTS: In both
               phantom and healthy participants, FAMESE provided accelerated and
               SNR-resistant T2 maps. The FAMESE had a very good agreement with
               the single-echo spin echo for the whole range of T2 values. The
               intraclass correlation coefficient values for FAMESE were
               excellent (ie, 0.9998 and 0.9860 < intraclass correlation
               coefficient < 0.9942 for the phantom and humans, respectively).
               CONCLUSION: Our developed method FAMESE could be considered as a

               These data are of great interest for the characterization of

               METHODS: Thirty-three PD patients and 26 age- and sex-matched
               healthy volunteers (HVs) were included in this study. Subjects
               underwent brain MRI and constructed QSM data. The differences in

               early-stage PD (EPD) group and the late-stage PD (LPD) group. The
               iron deposition pattern of the GP-FN-SN pathway was analyzed.
               RESULTS: The PD group showed increased susceptibility values in
               the FN, substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), internal globus
               pallidus (GPi), red nucleus (RN), putamen and caudate nucleus

               (GRE) imaging because transverse relaxation caused by magnetic
               field inhomogeneities is eliminated by the 180 degrees pulse at
               spin-echo imaging. T2* relaxation is one of the main determinants
               of image contrast with GRE sequences and forms the basis for many
               magnetic resonance (MR) applications, such as
               susceptibility-weighted (SW) imaging, perfusion MR imaging, and
               functional MR imaging. GRE sequences can be made predominantly
               T2* weighted by using a low flip angle, long echo time, and long
               repetition time. GRE sequences with T2*-based contrast are used

               alternative since it can provide absolute physical measurements
               of plaque components that can be standardized among different CMR
               systems and widely adopted in multi-centre studies. The purpose
               of this study was to investigate the use of in-vivo T2 mapping
               for atherosclerotic plaque characterization by performing
               American Heart Association (AHA) plaque type classification,
               segmenting carotid T2 maps and measuring in-vivo T2 values of
               plaque components. METHODS: The carotid arteries of 15
               atherosclerotic patients (11 males, 71 ± 10 years) were imaged at
               3 T using the conventional multicontrast protocol and
               Multiple-Spin-Echo (Multi-SE). T2 maps of carotid arteries were
               generated by mono-exponential fitting to the series of images
               acquired by Multi-SE using nonlinear least-squares regression.
               Two reviewers independently classified carotid plaque types
               following the CMR-modified AHA scheme, one using multicontrast
               CMR and the other using T2 maps and time-of-flight (TOF)
               angiography. A semi-automated method based on Bayes classifiers
               segmented the T2 maps of carotid arteries into 4 classes:
               calcification, lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), fibrous tissue
               and recent IPH. Mean ± SD of the T2 values of voxels classified
               as LRNC, fibrous tissue and recent IPH were calculated. RESULTS:
               In 37 images of carotid arteries from 15 patients, AHA plaque
               type classified by multicontrast CMR and by T2 maps (+ TOF)
               showed good agreement (76\% of matching classifications and
               Cohen's κ = 0.68). The T2 maps of 14 normal arteries were used to
               measure T2 of tunica intima and media (T2 = 54 ± 13 ms). From
               11865 voxels in the T2 maps of 15 arteries with advanced
               atherosclerosis, 2394 voxels were classified by the segmentation
               algorithm as LRNC (T2 = 37 ± 5 ms) and 7511 voxels as fibrous
               tissue (T2 = 56 ± 9 ms); 192 voxels were identified as
               calcification and one recent IPH (236 voxels, T2 = 107 ± 25 ms)
               was detected on T2 maps and confirmed by multicontrast CMR.
               CONCLUSIONS: This carotid CMR study shows the potential of
               in-vivo T2 mapping for atherosclerotic plaque characterization.
               Agreement between AHA plaque types classified by T2 maps (+TOF)
               and by conventional multicontrast CMR was good, and T2 measured
               in-vivo in LRNC, fibrous tissue and recent IPH demonstrated the
               ability to discriminate plaque components on T2 maps.",
