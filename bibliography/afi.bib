               B(1) mapping are widely used quantitative MRI methods employing
               radiofrequency spoiled gradient-echo pulse sequences. Incomplete
               elimination of the transverse magnetization in these sequences
               has been found to be a critical source of T(1) and B(1)
               measurement errors. In this study, comprehensive theoretical
               analysis of spoiling-related errors in variable flip angle and
               actual flip-angle imaging methods was performed using the
               combined isochromat summation and diffusion propagator model and
               validated by phantom experiments. The key theoretical conclusion
               is that correct interpretation of spoiling phenomena in fast
               gradient-echo sequences requires accurate consideration of the
               diffusion effect. A general strategy for improvement of T(1) and
               B(1) measurement accuracy was proposed based on the strong
               spoiling regimen, where diffusion-modulated spatial averaging of
               isochromats becomes a dominant factor determining magnetization
               evolution. Practical implementation of strongly spoiled variable
               flip angle and actual flip-angle imaging techniques requires
               sufficiently large spoiling gradient areas (A(G)) in combination
               with optimal radiofrequency phase increments (phi(0)). Optimal
               regimens providing <2\% relative T(1) and B(1) measurement errors

               of the transmitted radiofrequency (RF) field. The method employs
               an actual flip-angle imaging (AFI) pulse sequence that consists
               of two identical RF pulses followed by two delays of different
               duration (TR(1) < TR(2)). After each pulse, a gradient-echo (GRE)
               signal is acquired. It has been shown theoretically and
               experimentally that if delays TR(1) and TR(2) are sufficiently
               short and the transverse magnetization is completely spoiled, the
               ratio r = S(2)/S(1) of signal intensities S(1) and S(2), acquired
               at the beginning of the time intervals TR(1) and TR(2), depends

               mapping based on the Bloch-Siegert shift is presented. Unlike
               conventionally applied double-angle or other signal
               magnitude-based methods, it encodes the B(1) information into
               signal phase, resulting in important advantages in terms of
               acquisition speed, accuracy, and robustness. The Bloch-Siegert
               frequency shift is caused by irradiating with an off-resonance
               radiofrequency pulse following conventional spin excitation. When
               applying the off-resonance radiofrequency in the kilohertz range,
               spin nutation can be neglected and the primarily observed effect
               is a spin precession frequency shift. This shift is proportional
               to the square of the magnitude of B1(2). Adding gradient image
               encoding following the off-resonance pulse allows one to acquire
               spatially resolved B(1) maps. The frequency shift from the
               Bloch-Siegert effect gives a phase shift in the image that is
               proportional to B(1)(2). The phase difference of two
               acquisitions, with the radiofrequency pulse applied at two
               frequencies symmetrically around the water resonance, is used to
               eliminate undesired off-resonance effects due to amplitude of
               static field inhomogeneity and chemical shift. In vivo
               Bloch-Siegert B(1) mapping with 25 sec/slice is demonstrated to
               be quantitatively comparable to a 21-min double-angle map. As
               such, this method enables robust, high-resolution B(1)(+) mapping

               study this relationship more generally for pulsed saturation. It
               could be demonstrated, both theoretically and empirically, that
               for typical B(1) errors there is a linear relationship between

               observation of T1 (DESPOT1) T1 mapping method. MATERIALS AND
               METHODS: While DESPOT1 is a robust method for rapid whole-brain
               voxelwise mapping of the longitudinal relaxation time, the
               approach is inherently sensitive to inaccuracies in the
               transmitted flip angle, defined by the B1 field, which become
               more severe with increased field. Here we propose an extension of
               the DESPOT1 technique, involving the additional acquisition of an
               inversion-prepared SPGR image alongside the conventional
               multiangle DESPOT1 data. From these combined data both B1 and T1
               may be determined with high accuracy and precision. The method is
               evaluated at 3T with phantom and in vivo imaging experiments,
               with derived T1 estimates compared with values calculated from
               multiple inversion time inversion recovery data. RESULTS: The
               method provides robust correction of flip angle variations, with
               less than 5\% error compared with reference values for T1 between
               300 msec and 2500 msec. CONCLUSIONS: The described approach,
               dubbed DESPOT1-HIFI, permits whole-brain T1 mapping at 3T, with 1
               mm(3) isotropic voxels, in a clinically feasible time

               relation is exploited: B(1) mapping is achieved by a two-point
               extrapolation to signal null with a correction scheme while T(1)
               mapping uses the slopes of the SPGR signal vs flip angle curves
               near the origin and near the signal null. This new method
               improves upon the existing variable flip angle (VFA) T(1)-mapping
               method in that (i) consistency between B(1) and T(1) maps is
               ensured (ii) the sampling scheme is T(1)-independent (iii) the

               results via simulations. Initial estimates of B(1) and T(1)
               values are obtained from three data points via simple

               robustness of T(1) values is achieved via a non-linear fitting
               algorithm which includes a fourth data point sampled at high SNR.
               The MoS was validated by comparing resulting B(1) and T(1) maps

              intensity nonuniformity usually associated with linearly polarized
              radio-frequency (RF) coils is often present in neurological scans
              using circularly polarized coils, a theoretical analysis has been
              conducted of the intensity nonuniformity inherent in imaging an
              elliptically shaped object using 1.5-T magnets and circularly
              polarized RF coils. This first principle analysis clarifies, for
              the general case of conducting objects, the relationship between
              the excitation field and the reception sensitivity of circularly
              and linearly polarized coils. The results, validated
              experimentally using a standard spin-echo imaging sequence and an
              in vivo B1 field mapping technique, are shown to be accurate to
              within 1\%-2\% root mean square, suggesting that these
              electromagnetic interactions with the object account for most of
              the intensity nonuniformity observed.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: B1 mapping is important for many quantitative imaging
              protocols, particularly those that include whole-brain T1 mapping
              using the variable flip angle (VFA) technique. However, B1 mapping
              sequences are not typically available on many magnetic resonance
              imaging (MRI) scanners. The aim of this work was to demonstrate
              that B1 mapping implemented using standard scanner product pulse
              sequences can produce B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps comparable in quality
              and acquisition time to advanced techniques. MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Six healthy subjects were scanned at 3.0T. An interleaved
              multislice spin-echo echo planar imaging double-angle (EPI-DA) B1
              mapping protocol, using a standard product pulse sequence, was
              compared to two alternative methods (actual flip angle imaging,
              AFI, and Bloch-Siegert shift, BS). Single-slice spin-echo DA B1
              maps were used as a reference for comparison (Ref. DA). VFA flip
              angles were scaled using each B1 map prior to fitting T1 ; the
              nominal flip angle case was also compared. RESULTS: The
              pooled-subject voxelwise correlation (ρ) for B1 maps
              (BS/AFI/EPI-DA) relative to the reference B1 scan (Ref. DA) were ρ
              = 0.92/0.95/0.98. VFA T1 correlations using these maps were ρ =
              0.86/0.88/0.96, much better than without B1 correction (ρ = 0.53).
              The relative error for each B1 map (BS/AFI/EPI-DA/Nominal) had
              95th percentiles of 5/4/3/13\%. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that
              B1 mapping implemented using product pulse sequences can provide
              excellent quality B1 (and VFA T1 ) maps, comparable to other
              custom techniques. This fast whole-brain measurement (∼2 min) can
              serve as an excellent alternative for researchers without access
              to advanced B1 pulse sequences. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1 Technical

              experiments in which off-resonance saturation pulses are
              interleaved with on-resonance excitation pulses is presented. We
              apply this method to develop a steady-state signal equation for
              MT-weighted spoiled gradient echo sequences and consider
              approximations that facilitate its rapid computation. Using this

              quantitatively imaging the fractional size of the restricted pool,
              cross-relaxation rate, and T(1) and T(2) relaxation times of the
              two pools in a binary spin bath system. From experiments on agar
