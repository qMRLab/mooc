              demyelination with no axonal loss, mice intoxicated by cuprizone
              were studied by MTI in vivo at 9.4 T. MRI data were compared to
              histopathological examinations. RESULTS: Data revealed that the
              magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) decreased significantly during
              demyelination and increased during remyelination with strong
              correlation to the myelin content (r=0.79, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
              This study demonstrated that MTR is a sensitive and reproducible
              quantitative marker to assess myelin loss and repair. This may
              lead to in vivo monitoring of therapeutic strategies promoting

              T1-weighted images acquired with and without fat saturation pulses
              in the BECOME study were evaluated and found to exhibit
              magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) effects, and were used to
              compute MTR images (FSMTR). Forty-three participants who had the
              required imaging and new lesions, from the 75 originally
              randomized into the BECOME study, were included in this post hoc
              analysis and evaluated longitudinally during treatment to
              determine FSMTRDrop, an experimental measure of the completeness
              of FSMTR recovery in new lesions. Two sets of new brain MRI
              lesions were defined, one based on the appearance of gadolinium
              contrast enhancement (Gd lesions) and the other based on FSMTR
              decreases (ΔFSMTR lesions). RESULTS: A total of 887 Gd lesions
              were identified in 43 participants (19 GA, 24 IFN-β-1b) and 321
              ΔFSMTR lesions in 32 participants (16 GA, 16 IFN-β-1b).
              Participants randomized to GA exhibited greater average postlesion
              FSMTR recovery than did those randomized to IFN-β-1b in both Gd (p
              < 0.0001) and ΔFSMTR (p < 0.0001) lesions. CONCLUSIONS: New brain
              lesions that developed during treatment with GA exhibited evidence
              of greater FSMTR recovery than during treatment with IFN-β-1b.
              CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class III evidence
              that MTR recovery in patients with MS with new MRI brain lesions
              is greater with GA than with IFN-β-1b.",

               ratio (MTR) sequence in a multicenter clinical trial to detect
               lesion onset in multiple sclerosis (MS).BACKGROUND: MTR is used
               in MS studies to evaluate tissue integrity in patients. MTR in
               normal appearing white matter (NAWM) is higher than in active MS
               lesions, in which inflammation and demyelination occur.
               Post-lesion MTR may recover towards normal values as inflammatory
               edema resolves and remyelination occurs. Commonly, MTR is based
               on spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) sequences, taking more
               than 20 minutes to perform; however, balanced steady-state free
               precession (bSSFP) MTR, which takes approximately one-quarter of
               the time, would reduce scanning time for patients.DESIGN/METHODS:
               Patients (n = 7) across four radiological centers who were
               participating in a clinical trial of the sphingosine 1-phosphate
               receptor modulator, siponimod (BAF312), were scanned monthly for
               6 months using a protocol including pre- and post-gadolinium
               (Gd)-enhancing T1 magnetic resonance imaging and bSSFP MTR. MTR
               was not estimated at all time points (≤ 20 lesions were assessed
               at lesion onset; three lesions were assessed 4 months after
               onset). A neuroradiologist analyzed T1 images to identify
               Gd-enhancing lesions. MTR and T1-Gd sequences were co-registered
               to allow measurement of MTR in lesions of interest.RESULTS: The
               average MTR rapidly decreased from 40.8\% (standard deviation
               [SD]: 5.2\%) in the month before lesion onset to 36.6\% (SD:
               4.2\%) upon lesion onset. No significant increase occurred after
               lesion onset in this small cohort. Measurements outside the
               lesion were stable; mean MTR in grey matter was 31.5\% (SD:
               0.98\%) and NAWM 42.7\% (SD: 0.77\%), with low variation among
               patients.CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first use of
               bSSFP MTR in a multicenter trial. bSSFP MTR successfully detected
               changes associated with inflammatory lesion appearance similar to
               previous observations from longer MTR sequences.Supported by:

               describing the impact of B1 inaccuracies on qMT fitting
               parameters was derived using a sensitivity analysis. To
               simultaneously optimize for robustness against noise and B1

               Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) regularized by the B1 -sensitivity
               expression for the parameter of interest (F). The qMT protocols
               were iteratively optimized from an initial search space, with and
               without B1 regularization. Three 10-point qMT protocols (Uniform,
               CRLB, CRLB+B1 regularization) were compared using Monte Carlo
               simulations for a wide range of conditions (e.g., SNR, B1
               inaccuracies, tissues). RESULTS: The B1 -regularized CRLB
               optimization protocol resulted in the best robustness of F
               against B1 errors, for a wide range of SNR and for both white
               matter and gray matter tissues. For SNR = 100, this protocol
               resulted in errors of less than 1\% in mean F values for B1
               errors ranging between -10 and 20\%, the range of B1 values
               typically observed in vivo in the human head at field strengths
               of 3 T and less. Both CRLB-optimized protocols resulted in the
               lowest σF values for all SNRs and did not increase in the
               presence of B1 inaccuracies. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates a
               regularized optimization approach for improving the robustness of
               auxiliary measurements (e.g., B1 ) sensitivity of qMT parameters,
               particularly the pool-size ratio (F). Predicting substantially
               less B1 sensitivity using protocols optimized with this method,
               B1 mapping could even be omitted for qMT studies primarily

              remyelination. This technique comprises a definition of ΔMTR
              lesions, which are identified directly from the MTR images, and an
              automatic procedure for segmenting these lesions. We used this
              technique to analyze MTR changes in lesions of subjects with
              rapidly progressing multiple sclerosis before and after treatment
              with immunoablation and autologous stem cell transplant. Subjects
              who experienced clinical improvement after treatment showed
              significantly improved MTR recovery in lesions that were
              recovering during treatment (p<0.0001) while those who were
              clinically stable after treatment showed significantly poorer MTR
              recovery (p=0.002). The statistical power of this technique to
              detect treatment effects on MTR recovery was shown to be
              considerably better than previous methods. These results suggest
              that longitudinal measurements of MTR in ΔMTR lesions may be an
              important technique for the assessment of treatment effects on
              remyelination in clinical trials.",

              vendor-neutral acquisition and tested the hypothesis that
              vendor-neutral sequences decrease inter-vendor variability of T1,
              magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and magnetization transfer
              saturation-index (MTsat) measurements. METHODS: We developed and
              deployed a vendor-neutral 3D spoiled gradient-echo (SPGR) sequence
              on three clinical scanners by two MRI vendors. We then acquired T1
              maps on the ISMRM-NIST system phantom, as well as T1, MTR, and
              MTsat maps in three healthy participants. We performed
              hierarchical shift function analysis in vivo to characterize the
              differences between scanners when the vendor-neutral sequence is
              used instead of commercial vendor implementations. Inter-vendor
              deviations were compared for statistical significance to test the
              hypothesis. RESULTS: In the phantom, the vendor-neutral sequence
              reduced inter-vendor differences from 8\% to 19.4\% to 0.2\% to
              5\% with an overall accuracy improvement, reducing ground truth T1
              deviations from 7\% to 11\% to 0.2\% to 4\%. In vivo, we found
              that the variability between vendors is significantly reduced (p =
              0.015) for all maps (T1, MTR, and MTsat) using the vendor-neutral
              sequence. CONCLUSION: We conclude that vendor-neutral workflows
              are feasible and compatible with clinical MRI scanners. The
              significant reduction of inter-vendor variability using
              vendor-neutral sequences has important implications for qMRI
              research and for the reliability of multicenter clinical trials.",
