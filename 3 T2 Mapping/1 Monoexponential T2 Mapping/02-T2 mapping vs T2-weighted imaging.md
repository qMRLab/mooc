The standard practice in clinical MRI is T2-weighted imaging (T2w), i.e. images in which the different tissues produce signals according to their T2 relaxation times. T2w images are considered qualitative, as they rely on differences in T2 relaxation of various tissues to provide contrast rather than actual quantitative tissue measurements, thus making their interpretation dependent on the observer. Meanwhile, T2 mapping is considered a quantitative technique, as it directly measures the T2 relaxation time of tissues by fitting multiple data points to a decay curve to calculate the T2 constant. The objective nature of T2 mapping makes it a promising technique for various applications in both clinical practice and research, including disease progression monitoring and the identification of novel biomarkers. Another advantage of T2 mapping is that it allows for consistent comparisons across different imaging protocols, thereby enhancing reproducibility and making it ideal for longitudinal and multi-institutional studies (Margaret Cheng et al., 2012). Figure 1 shows several examples of T2w images acquired at different echo times, compared to the T2 map generated by fitting the decay curve.
