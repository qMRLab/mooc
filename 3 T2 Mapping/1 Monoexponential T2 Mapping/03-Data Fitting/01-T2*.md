Until now, we have assumed that the transverse signal (Mxy) decays exponentially with the echo time divided by the T2 constant (see equation 3). However, in practice, other factors such as B0 inhomogeneities can cause a more rapid loss of the transverse signal; this results in a faster transverse decay, which is referred to as T2* relaxation (see Figure 2). 

The relation between T2 and T2*  is described as follows (Brown et al., 2014) : 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} =  \frac{1}{T_{2}}  +  \frac{1}{T_{2}^{'}} 
\end{equation}

Where T2′ quantifies the portion of relaxation which is due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. Some studies suggest that T2′ mapping, which can be performed by removing the T2 relaxation effect from T2*, could offer valuable insights for brain disease diagnosis, notably by quantifying blood oxygenation levels (D. Lee et al., 2014) and to predict infarct growth in acute stroke patients (Siemonsen, Fitting, et al., 2008). 

The T2* decay can then be calculated using the same methods as T2, where equation (3) can be rewritten as follows : 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:2}
\textit{S}\left ( TE \right ) = S_{0}e^{-TE/T_{2}}
\end{equation}

Unlike T2 mapping, which uses spin echo type sequences, T2* mapping is performed using gradient echo sequences (GRE), as they are sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities (Cohen-Adad, 2014; Markl & Leupold, 2012). Nonetheless, there are specialized sequences such as the spin and gradient echo (SAGE) sequence (Stokes et al., 2014) that enable the simultaneous acquisition of both T2 and T2*.
