Until now, we have assumed that the transverse signal (Mxy) decays exponentially with the echo time divided by the _T_{sub}`2` constant (see [](#t2Eq3)). However, in practice, other factors such as B0 inhomogeneities can cause a more rapid loss of the transverse signal; this results in a faster transverse decay, which is referred to as _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*` relaxation (see [](#t2Plot1)). 

The relation between _T_{sub}`2` and _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*`  is described as follows (Brown et al., 2014) : 

```{math}
:label: t2Eq3
:enumerator:3.3
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{T_{2}^{*}} =  \frac{1}{T_{2}}  +  \frac{1}{T_{2}^{'}} 
\end{equation}
```

Where _T_{sub}`2`′ quantifies the portion of relaxation which is due to magnetic field inhomogeneities. Some studies suggest that _T_{sub}`2`′ mapping, which can be performed by removing the _T_{sub}`2` relaxation effect from _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*`, could offer valuable insights for brain disease diagnosis, notably by quantifying blood oxygenation levels (D. Lee et al., 2014) and to predict infarct growth in acute stroke patients (Siemonsen, Fitting, et al., 2008). 

The _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*` decay can then be calculated using the same methods as _T_{sub}`2`, where [](#t2Eq3) can be rewritten as follows : 

```{math}
:label: t2Eq4
:enumerator:3.4
\begin{equation}
\textit{S}\left ( TE \right ) = S_{0}e^{-TE/T_{2}}
\end{equation}
```

Unlike _T_{sub}`2` mapping, which uses spin echo type sequences, _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*` mapping is performed using gradient echo sequences (GRE), as they are sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities (Cohen-Adad, 2014; Markl & Leupold, 2012). Nonetheless, there are specialized sequences such as the spin and gradient echo (SAGE) sequence (Stokes et al., 2014) that enable the simultaneous acquisition of both _T_{sub}`2` and _T_{sub}`2`{sup}`*`.
