# **(TI = 50 ms)**

## INCORRECT ANSWER

You selected a very short TI of 50 ms. Here is what an inversion recovery image with this TI would look like:

:::{figure} #flair4ajn
:label: flairPlot4a
:enumerator: 7.3
Inversion recovery image with TI = 50 ms, TR = 5 s, TE = 15 ms, FA = 90 degrees
:::

As you can see, there is little contrast at all accross tissues for a very short TI, as can be deduced via [](#irPlot2). No tissue signal is nulled. Here are the simulated images for the three other answers: [](#flairPlot4b), [](#flairPlot4c), and [](#flairPlot4d).
