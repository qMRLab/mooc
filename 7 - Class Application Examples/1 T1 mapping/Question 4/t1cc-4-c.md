# (TI = 1 s)

## INCORRECT ANSWER

You selected a TI of 1 s. Here is what an inversion recovery image with this TI would look like:

:::{figure} #flair4cjn
:label: flairPlot4c
:enumerator: 7.5
Inversion recovery image with TI = 1 s, TR = 5 s, TE = 15 ms, FA = 90 degrees
:::

As you can see, grey matter is quite dark, meaning this TI nulls the grey matter signal. This could have been deduced from [](#irPlot2) by hovering the cursor over the grey matter signal where it crosses 0. Here are the simulated images for the three other answers: [](#flairPlot4a), [](#flairPlot4b), and [](#flairPlot4d).
