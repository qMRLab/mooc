# (TI = 500 ms)

## INCORRECT ANSWER

You selected a TI of 500 ms. Here is what an inversion recovery image with this TI would look like:

:::{figure} #flair4bjn
:label: flairPlot4b
:enumerator: 7.4
Inversion recovery image with TI = 500 ms, TR = 5 s, TE = 15 ms, FA = 90 degrees
:::

As you can see, white matter is quite dark, meaning this TI nulls the white matter signal. This could have been deduced from [](#irPlot2) by hovering the cursor over the white matter signal where it crosses 0. Here are the simulated images for the three other answers: [](#flairPlot4a), [](#flairPlot4c), and [](#flairPlot4d).
