# (TI = 3 s)

## CORRECT ANSWER

**You got the correct answer!**

You selected a TI of 3 s. Here is what an inversion recovery image with this TI would look like:

:::{figure} #flair4djn
:label: flairPlot4d
:enumerator: 7.6
Inversion recovery image with TI = 3 s, TR = 5 s, TE = 15 ms, FA = 90 degrees
:::

As you can see, ventricles are quite dark, meaning this TI nulls the ventricular signal. This is clearly deduced from [](#irPlot2) by hovering the cursor over the white matter signal where it crosses 0. Here are the simulated images for the three other answers: []#flairPlot4a), [](#flairPlot4b), and [](#flairPlot4c).
