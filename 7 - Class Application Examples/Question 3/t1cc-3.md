If you landed on using an inversion recovery sequence with an inversion time that nulls the ventricular signal, congratulation, you just discovered **FLAIR (FLuid Attenuation Inversion Recovery)**! This is a widely used technique, particular in suspected MS cases. It provides good T2 weighting with nearly no signal in purely ventricular regions.

Let's design a FLAIR protocol!

Using [](#irPlot4) and [](#irPlot1), approximately what inversion time should your sequence have?

**A** - {button}`(TI = 50 ms) <#flairt1cc4a>`

**B** - {button}`(TI = 500 ms) <#flairt1cc4b>`

**C** - {button}`(TI = 1 s) <#flairt1cc4c>`

**D** - {button}`(TI = 3 s) <#flairt1cc4d>`
