# Return to Case Study

The radiologist expresses concern that the standard T2-weighted image does not provide sufficient contrast to clearly identify periventricular lesions, which are a hallmark of MS. Given that these lesions are expected to consist of inflamed axon fibers with higher water content, the radiologist asks for your help in designing an imaging protocol that can better differentiate between the hyperintense CSF in the ventricles and the hyperintense periventricular lesions.

Look at [](#flairPlot1), can you easily identify these lesions?

From the information provided above, how do you think the T1 and T2 values will differ in a lesions vs normal white matter?

**A** - {button}`(T1 increased, T2 decreases) <#flairt1cc2a>`

**B** - {button}`(T1 decreases, T2 increases) <#flairt1cc2b>`

**C** - {button}`(T1 increase, T2 barely changes) <#flairt1cc2c>`

**D** - {button}`(T1 barely changes, T2 increases) <#flairt1cc2d>`
