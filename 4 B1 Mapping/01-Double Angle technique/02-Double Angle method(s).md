The Double Angle method (DA or DAM) is a class of B1 mapping technique swherein two RF pulses at flip angles α and 2α are applied to a pulse sequence, and the ratio of the images are compared to expected output to produce a B1 map. Several main pulse sequences (Figure 1) have been called the double angle method in the literature, and both have their own equations describing the relationship between the expected images and B1. In this chapter, we’ll mostly explore there the α-180 method (Figure 1a), and then briefly explain the other method and its similarities/differences.
